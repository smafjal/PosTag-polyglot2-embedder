Confidence in the pound is widely expected to take another sharp dive if trade figures for September due for release tomorrow fail to show a substantial improvement from July and August 's near-record deficits
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's restated commitment to a firm monetary policy has helped to prevent a freefall in sterling over the past week
But analysts reckon underlying support for sterling has been eroded by the chancellor 's failure to announce any new policy measures in his Mansion House speech last Thursday
This has increased the risk of the government being forced to increase base rates to 16 % from their current 15 % level to defend the pound economists and foreign exchange market analysts say
The risks for sterling of a bad trade figure are very heavily on the down side said Chris Dillow senior U.K. economist at Nomura Research Institute
If there is another bad trade number there could be an awful lot of pressure noted Simon Briscoe U.K. economist for Midland Montagu a unit of Midland Bank PLC
Forecasts for the trade figures range widely but few economists expect the data to show a very marked improvement from the 2 billion 3.2 billion deficit in the current account reported for August
The August deficit and the 2.2 billion gap registered in July are topped only by the 2.3 billion deficit of October 1988
Sanjay Joshi European economist at Baring Brothers & Co. said there is no sign that Britain 's manufacturing industry is transforming itself to boost exports
At the same time he remains fairly pessimistic about the outlook for imports given continued high consumer and capital goods inflows
He reckons the current account deficit will narrow to only 1.8 billion in September
However Mr. Dillow said he believes that a reduction in raw material stockbuilding by industry could lead to a sharp drop in imports
Combined with at least some rebound in exports after August 's unexpected decline the deficit could narrow to as little as 1.3 billion
Mr. Briscoe who also forecasts a 1.3 billion current account gap warns that even if the trade figures are bullish for sterling the currency wo n't advance much because investors will want to see further evidence of the turnaround before adjusting positions
Nevertheless he noted No one will want to go into the trade figures without a flat position in the pound
Meanwhile overall evidence on the economy remains fairly clouded
In his Mansion House speech Mr. Lawson warned that a further slowdown can be expected as the impact of the last rise in interest rates earlier this month takes effect
U.K. base rates are at their highest level in eight years
But consumer expenditure data released Friday do n't suggest that the U.K. economy is slowing that quickly
The figures show that spending rose 0.1 % in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up 3.8 % from a year ago
This compares with a 1.6 % rise in the second from the first quarter and a 5.4 % increase from the second quarter of 1988
Mr. Dillow said the data show the economy is still quite strong but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather than consumer goods should reduce fears of more import rises
Certainly the chancellor has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest rates again if necessary to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling does n't decline further
Thursday he reminded his audience that the government can not allow the necessary rigor of monetary policy to be undermined by exchange rate weakness
Analysts agree there is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than Mr. Lawson 's promise that rates will be pushed higher if necessary
And they warn any further drop in the government 's popularity could swiftly make this promise sound hollow
Sterling was already showing some signs of a lack of confidence in Mr. Lawson 's promise Friday
In European trading it declined to 1.5890 and 2.9495 marks from 1.5940 and 2.9429 marks late Thursday
Economists suggested that if the pound falls much below 2.90 marks the government will be forced to increase rates to 16 % both to halt any further decline and ensure that the balance of monetary policy remains unchanged
Friday 's Market Activity The dollar posted gains in quiet trading as concerns about equities abated
Foreign exchange dealers said that the currency market has begun to distance itself from the volatile stock exchange which has preoccupied the market since Oct. 13 when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 190 points
Currency analysts predict that in the coming week the foreign exchange market will shift its focus back to economic fundamentals keeping a close eye out for any signs of monetary easing by U.S. Federal Reserve
Late in the New York trading day the dollar was quoted at 1.8578 marks up from 1.8470 marks late Thursday in New York

Freight rates declining for most of the decade because of competition spurred by deregulation are bottoming out turning upward and threatening to fuel inflation
Trucking shipping and air-freight companies have announced rate increases scheduled for this fall or early next year reflecting higher costs and tightened demand for freight transport
Major shippers say they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years
That 's a big change from recent years when freight haulage was a bright spot for U.S. productivity helping to restrain inflation and make U.S. industry more competitive abroad
Demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation and rates are starting to move up at a rate close to or slightly more than the inflation rate said Clifford Sayre director of logistics at Du Pont Co
Shippers surveyed recently by Ohio State University said they expect their freight-transport storage and distribution costs to rise about 4 % this year
Only 10 % of the 250 shippers polled expected their freight-transport costs to decrease compared with 30 % who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years
This is the first year since transportation deregulation in 1980 that we have had such a dramatic and broad-based upturn in perceived transportation rates said Bernard LaLonde a transportation logistics professor at Ohio State in Columbus
The deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that began in 1980 enabled shippers to bargain for transportation
Carriers could use their equipment more efficiently leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill
Shippers cut about 35 billion from their annual inter-city truck and rail costs to about 150 billion or about 6.4 % of gross national product down from 8 % of GNP in 1981
But with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight-transport system rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight rates
Shippers are saying the party 's over said Mr. LaLonde
Shippers wo n't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years
Transport rates wo n't be an opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy
Robert Delaney a consultant at Arthur D. Little Inc. Cambridge Mass. said We 've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight-cost reductions
Now we are starting to see real freight-rate increases as carriers replace equipment pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor
You 'll see carriers try to recoup some of the price cutting that occurred previously
Not everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers
There 's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck said Gerard McCullough lecturer in transportation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Less-than-truckload companies which carry the freight of several shippers in each truck trailer discounted away a 4.7 % rate increase implemented last April
The carriers were competing fiercely for market share
Railroad-rate increases are likely to be restrained by weakening rail-traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks
An official at Consolidated Freightways Inc. a Menlo Park Calif. less-than-truckload carrier said rate discounting in that industry has begun to stabilize
Consolidated Freightways plans to raise its rates 5.3 % late this year or early next year and at least two competitors have announced similar increases
Truckers are trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting forget about market share and go for higher rates said Michael Lloyd an analyst at Salomon Bros
And shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one trucker off against another as much as they can he said
Air-freight carriers raised their rates for U.S. products going across the Pacific to Asia by about 20 % earlier this month
And Japan Air Lines said it plans to boost its rates a further 25 % over the next two years
Such rate increases will increase the total cost of U.S. products and slow down the rate of increase of U.S. exports said Richard Connors a senior vice president of Yusen Air & Sea Service U.S.A. Inc. the U.S. air-freight-forwarding subsidiary of Nippon Yusen Kaisha of Japan
Ship companies carrying bulk commodities such as oil grain coal and iron ore have been able to increase their rates in the last couple of years
Some bulk shipping rates have increased 3 % to 4 % in the past few months said Salomon 's Mr. Lloyd
And ship lines carrying containers are also trying to raise their rates
Carriers boosted rates more than 10 % in the North Atlantic between the U.S. and Europe last September hoping to partly restore rates to earlier levels
Ship lines operating in the Pacific plan to raise rates on containers carrying U.S. exports to Asia about 10 % effective next April
MGM Grand Inc. said it filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a public offering of six million common shares
The Beverly Hills Calif.-based company said it would have 26.9 million common shares outstanding after the offering
The hotel and Gaming company said Merrill Lynch Capital Markets will lead the underwriters
Proceeds from the sale will be used for remodeling and refurbishing projects as well as for the planned MGM Grand hotel\/casino and theme park
Bob Stone stewed over a letter from his manager putting him on probation for insubordination
Mr. Stone thought the discipline was unfair he believed that his manager wanted to get rid of him for personal reasons
Unable to persuade the manager to change his decision he went to a company court for a hearing
At the scheduled time Mr. Stone entered a conference room in a building near where he worked
After the three members of the court introduced themselves the chairman of the panel said Go ahead and tell us what happened
We may ask questions as you go along or we may wait until the end
No lawyers or tape recorders were present
The only extra people were a couple of personnel specialists one of whom knew Mr. Stone 's case intimately and would help fill in any facts needed to give the court the full picture
Over a cup of coffee Mr. Stone told his story
He talked about 20 minutes
When he was through the court members asked many questions then the chairman said they would like to hear his manager 's side and talk to witnesses
The chairman promised Mr. Stone a decision within two weeks
Bob Stone is a fictional name but the incident described is real
It happened at Northrop Corp. in Los Angeles
The court is called the Management Appeals Committee or just MAC and it is likely to hear a couple of dozen cases a year
Alter some details of this example and it could be taking place today at Federal Express in Memphis the Defense and Underseas Systems divisions of Honeywell in Minneapolis a General Electric plant in Columbia Md. or a number of other companies
These firms are pioneers in a significant new trend in the corporate world the rise of what I call corporate due process
Although corporate due process is practiced today in few companies perhaps 40 to 60 it is one of the fastest developing trends in industry
In the coming decade a majority of people-oriented companies are likely to adopt it
Corporate due process appeals to management for a variety of reasons
It reduces lawsuits from disgruntled employees and ex-employees with all that means for reduced legal costs and better public relations
It helps to keep out unions
It increases employee commitment to the company with all that means for efficiency and quality control
What must your management team do to establish corporate due process Here are four key steps 1
Make sure you have a strong personnel department
It must be able to handle most of the complaints that can not be solved in the trenches by managers and their subordinates else the company court or adjudicators will be inundated with cases
At Polaroid the Personnel Policy Planning Committee may hear only about 20 cases a year the rest of the many hundreds of complaints are resolved at earlier stages
At TWA the System Board of Adjustment hears 50 to 75 cases a year only a fraction of the complaints brought to personnel specialists
At Citicorp the Problem Review Board may hear only 12 or so cases because of personnel 's skill in complaint-resolution
In a typical year up to 20 % of the work force goes to personnel specialists with complaints of unfair treatment
In a large company that means many hundreds of complaints for personnel to handle
2
Formally or informally train all your managers and supervisors in the company 's due-process approach
See that they know company personnel policy backwards and forwards for it is the law governing company courts and adjudicators
Coach them in handling complaints so that they can resolve problems immediately
In case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or adjudicator teach managers to accept reversals as a fact of business life for in a good due-process system they are bound to happen
In the 15 companies I studied reversal rates range on the average from 20 % to 40 %
3
Decide whether you want a panel system or a single adjudicator
A panel system like that in the Bob Stone example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and for the panelists mutual support
An adjudicator system that is an investigator who acts first as a fact-finder and then switches hats and arbitrates the facts has such advantages as speed flexibility and maximum privacy
International Business Machines and Bank of America are among the companies using the single-adjudicator approach
4
Make your due-process system visible
It wo n't do any good for anybody unless employees know about it
Most managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints
On the other hand they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel specialists
Smith-Kline Beecham goes further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed-circuit TV programs
Naturally one of the best ways to guarantee visibility for your due-process system is for top management to support it
At IBM the company 's Open Door system is sometimes the subject of memorandums from the chief executive
Federal Express goes further in this respect than any company I know of with both Frederick Smith and James Barksdale chief executive and chief operating officer respectively sitting in on the Appeals Board almost every Tuesday to decide cases

Winners outpaced losers 572 to 368 while 181 issues remained unchanged
With investors relieved at the overnight gain in New York stocks small-lot buying orders streamed into the market from early morning making traders believe the market was back to normal
The Nikkei which reached as high as 35611.38 right after the opening surrendered part of its early advance toward the end of the day because of profit-taking
Investors especially dealers do n't want to hold a position over the weekend a trader at Dai-ichi Securities said adding though that the trading mood remained positive through the afternoon session
The Tokyo Stock Price Index Topix of all issues listed in the First Section which gained 22.78 points Thursday was up 14.06 points or 0.53 % at 2679.72
The Second Section index which rose 15.72 points Thursday was up 11.88 points or 0.32 % to close at 3717.46
Volume in the second section was estimated at 30 million shares up from 28 million Thursday
In turmoil caused by the previous Friday 's plunge in New York stocks the Nikkei marked a sharp 647.33-point fall Monday
But the Nikkei fell an overall 1.8 % in value that day compared with Wall Street 's far sharper 6.9 % drop on Oct. 13
The Tokyo market 's resiliency helped participants to regain confidence gradually as they spent more time on analyzing factors that caused the Friday plunge and realized these problems were unique to New York stocks and not directly related to Tokyo
The Nikkei continued to gain for the rest of the week adding 1017.69 points in four days more than erasing Monday 's losses
But further major advances on the Nikkei are n't foreseen this week by market observers

London share prices were influenced largely by declines on Wall Street and weakness in the British pound
The key Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 10.2 points lower at 2179.1 above its intraday low of 2176.9 but off the day 's high of 2189
The index finished 2.4 % under its close of 2233.9 the previous Friday although it recouped some of the sharp losses staged early last week on the back of Wall Street 's fall
London was weak throughout Friday 's trading however on what dealers attributed to generally thin interest ahead of the weekend and this week 's potentially important U.K. trade figures for September
The FT-SE 100 largely remained within an 11-point range establshed within the first hour of trading before it eased to an intraday low late in the session when a flurry of program selling pushed Wall Street lower
The FT 30-share index closed 11.0 points lower at 1761.0
Volume was extremely thin at 351.3 million shares the lightest volume of the week and modestly under Thursday 's 387.4 million shares
Dealers said the day 's action was featureless outside some response to sterling 's early weakness against the mark and fears that Wall Street might open lower after its strong leap forward Thursday
They added that market-makers were largely sidelined after aggressively supporting the market Thursday in their quest to cover internal shortages of FT-SE 100 shares
Interest may remain limited into tomorrow 's U.K. trade figures which the market will be watching closely to see if there is any improvement after disappointing numbers in the previous two months
The key corporate news of the day was that British Airways decided to withdraw from a management-led bid for UAL Corp. the parent of United Airlines
British Airways rose initially after announcing its withdrawal from the UAL deal

Its shares slid in late dealings to close a penny per share lower at 197 pence
The airline was the most active FT-SE 100 at 8.2 million shares traded
The next most active top-tier stock was B.A.T Industries the target of Sir James Goldsmith 's 13.4 billion bid

The U.S. is required to notify foreign dictators if it knows of coup plans likely to endanger their lives government officials said
The notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret 1988 exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence Committee
The existence of the guidelines has become known since President Bush disclosed them privately to seven Republican senators at a White House meeting last Monday
Officials familiar with the meeting said Mr. Bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month 's futile effort to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega
According to the officials Mr. Bush even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the White House discussing the guidelines
They said the president conceded the notification requirement did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month 's Panama coup effort
No notification was ever considered officials said apparently because the U.S. did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega but merely sought to imprison him
What 's more both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House
The rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12 a few days before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules
However the disclosure of the guidelines first reported last night by NBC News is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress
It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the White House and Congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. Noriega and more broadly for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad
A statement issued by the office of the committee chairman Sen. David Boren D. Okla. charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in Panama
The statement added Someone has regrettably chosen to selectively summarize portions of highly classified correspondence between the two branches of government
Not only does this come close to a violation of law it violates the trust we have all worked to develop
Sen. Boren said It 's time to stop bickering and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy to help the country in the future
I 've invited the president to send his suggestions to the committee
Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine the panel 's vice chairman said of the disclosure that a text torn out of context is a pretext and it is unfair for those in the White House who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion
Sen. Boren said the committee could n't defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate classification rules
But the chairman and other committee members stressed that the notification guideline was n't imposed on the White House by a meddling Congress
Instead both congressional and administration officials agreed it grew out of talks about coup-planning in Panama that were initiated by the administration in July 1988 and stretched into last October
The guideline was n't a law but a joint interpretation of how the U.S. might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a U.S. role in assassinations
In fact yesterday the administration and Congress were still differing on what had been agreed to
One administration official said notification was required even if the U.S. gets wind of somebody else 's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator 's life
But a congressional source close to the panel said the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the U.S.
Although the notification guideline was n't carried out in this month 's coup attempt some administration officials argue that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of U.S. intelligence and military operatives in Panama
One senior administration official called the guideline outrageous and said it could make U.S. operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble
The issue came to a head last year officials recalled partly because the Reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new Panama coup efforts
In addition both administration and congressional officials said the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a White House desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign
Though the assassination ban is a White House order that Congress never voted on the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation
Last week Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster publicly called on Congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the U.S. more freedom to act in coups
The administration has reacted to criticism that it mishandled the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame Congress for restrictions the White House said have hampered its freedom of action
However last week Mr. Webster 's two top CIA deputies said congressional curbs had n't hampered the spy agency 's role in the coup attempt in Panama
Nevertheless the administration 's criticisms appeared to have made some headway with Sens. Boren and Cohen after their Oct. 12 meeting with the president
The three men agreed to rewrite the guidelines without changing the basic assassination ban to clear up any ambiguities that may have hampered U.S. encouragement of coups against anti-American leaders
The new argument over the notification guideline however could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that existed

MUTUAL FUNDS ARRIVED IN THE U.S. during the Roaring Twenties they had been in Britain for a century but they did n't boom until the money market fund was created in the 1970s
By 1980 there were more than 100 such funds
Besides creating a vehicle for investors money market funds also helped rewrite banking regulations
The idea was to let small investors the backbone of the fund business deal in the money market 's high short-term interest rates
This had been the exclusive province of those rich enough to use six-figure sums to get income that was figured beyond the third or fourth decimal place
The now-standard price of 1 a share came about by accident
An early fund had filed a registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission that included a fixed 1 price
It arrived just as the regulator handling such operations was retiring
His successor approved the 1 price in the process of clearing the backed-up papers on his desk
When Dreyfus started the first advertising-backed retail fund in February 1974 it was priced at 10 a share and reached 1 billion in assets in one year
Dreyfus moved to the 1 price after the SEC set standards an average 120-day maturity of high-grade paper that are still the rule
Keeping the listed price at a dollar is primarily a convenience
Actually the funds do fluctuate but beyond the third decimal place
Rounding-off keeps them at 1
Eventually the money funds ' success forced relaxation of curbs on bank interest rates to allow banks to offer competing yields
The new instrument also introduced many to the industry 30 % of fund owners there are more than 54 million accounts started with a money fund
Today more than 470 money market funds have total assets exceeding 350 billion
The companion tax-exempt funds add 71 billion

The government issues its first reading on third-quarter real gross national product this week in a report that is expected to disclose much tamer inflation
The consensus view on real GNP the total value of the nation 's output of goods and services adjusted for inflation calls for a 2.3 % gain down from the second quarter 's 2.5 % according to MMS International a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. New York
But inflation as measured by the GNP deflator in Thursday 's report is expected to rise only 3.5 % down from 4.6 % in the second quarter
Inflation could be a real surprise said Samuel D. Kahan chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. in Chicago
If that gets people excited it could serve as an impetus to the fixed-income markets to lower their rates he added
The week 's other notable indicators include mid-October auto sales September durable goods orders as well as September personal income personal consumption and the saving rate
Most are expected to fall below previous-month levels
Many economists see even slower GNP growth for the remainder of the year with some leaning more strongly toward a possible recession
In addition to softer production data weaker housing starts and lower corporate profits currently in evidence some analysts believe the two recent natural disasters Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake will carry economic ramifications in the fourth quarter
The recent one-day 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average seems to be significant to economists mainly for its tacit comment on the poor quality of third-quarter profits now being reported
The stock market is sick because profits are crumbling says Michael K. Evans president of Evans Economics Inc. Washington
The economy he noted moves the market not vice versa
On the other hand Mr. Evans expects the hurricane and the earthquake to take a hunk out of fourth-quarter GNP
His estimate of 3.3 % for third-quarter GNP is higher than the consensus largely because he believes current inventories are n't as low as official figures indicate
Demand he believes is being met from overhang rather than new production
By and large economists believe the two natural catastrophes will limit economic damage to their regions
Edward J. Campbell economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. New York noted that large increases in construction activity along with government and private relief efforts could offset loss of production in those areas
Gary Ciminero economist at Fleet\/Norstar Financial Group Providence R.I. expects the deflator to rise 3.7 % well below the second quarter 's 4.6 % partly because of what he believes will be temporarily better price behavior
He expects real GNP growth of only 2.1 % for the quarter noting a wider trade deficit slower capital and government spending and the lower inventory figures
Sung Won Sohn chief economist at Norwest Corp. Minneapolis holds that the recent stock-market volatility increases the possibility of economic recession and reinforces the bad news from recent trade deficit employment and housing reports
The consensus calls for a 0.5 % increase in September personal income and a 0.3 % gain in consumption

Vickers PLC a United Kingdom defense and engineering company said an investment unit controlled by New Zealand financier Ron Brierley raised its stake in the company Friday to 15.02 % from about 14.6 % Thursday and from 13.7 % the previous week
I.E.P. Securities Ltd. a unit of Mr. Brierley 's Hong Kong-based Industrial Equity Pacific Ltd. boosted its holdings in Vickers to 38.8 million shares
The latest purchase follows small increases in his holdings made over the past five months
In May Mr. Brierley 's stake shrank to 8.7 % after ranging between 9 % and 11 % for much of the previous year
Ron Brierley clearly views our company as a good investment a Vickers spokesman said
The spokesman refused to comment on speculation that Industrial Equity might use its interest as a platform to launch a hostile bid for the company

When Rune Andersson set out to revive flagging Swedish conglomerate Trelleborg AB in the early 1980s he spurned the advice of trendy management consultants
All these consultants kept coming around telling us we should concentrate on high technology electronics or biotechnology and get out of mature basic industries Mr. Andersson recalls
Yet under its 45-year-old president Trelleborg moved aggressively into those unfashionable base industries first strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division later adding mining as well as building and construction materials
It was a gutsy move for a little-known executive fired after only two months as president of his previous company
But going against the grain has never bothered Mr. Andersson
Stroking his trademark white goatee during a recent interview the diminutive Swede quips It turned out to be lucky for us
If the whole market thinks what you 're doing is crazy you do n't have much competition
Mr. Andersson is anxious to strengthen Trelleborg 's balance sheet
Characteristically he did n't waste much time getting started
On Tuesday Trelleborg 's directors announced plans to spin off two big divisions minerals processing and building and distribution as separately quoted companies on Stockholm 's Stock Exchange
At current market prices the twin public offerings to be completed next year would add an estimated 2.5 billion Swedish kronor 386 million to Trelleborg 's coffers analysts say
The board had also been expected to approve a SKr1.5 billion international offering of new Trelleborg shares
But that share issue intended to make Trelleborg better known among international investors was postponed until market conditions stabilize people familiar with the situation say
Trelleborg 's internationally traded Bfree series stock plunged SKr29 4.48 to SKr205 31.65 in volatile trading Monday in Stockholm
Tuesday the shares regained SKr20 closing at SKr225
Mr. Andersson says he is confident that taking parts of the company public will help erase the conglomerate stigma that has held down Trelleborg 's share price
Trelleborg plans to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly less than 50 % of both units
The spinoff should solve a problem for the parent
A family foundation set up by late founder Henry Dunker controls 59 % of Trelleborg 's voting shares outstanding
But the foundation bylaws require the entire Trelleborg stake to be sold in the open market if control drops below 50 %
That possibility had crept closer as repeated new share offerings to finance Trelleborg 's rapid growth steadily diluted the foundation 's holding
That growth is the result of Mr. Andersson 's shopping spree during which he has bought and sold more than 100 companies during the past five years
Most of the new additions were barely profitable if not outright loss makers
Applying prowess gained during earlier stints at appliance maker AB Electrolux Mr. Andersson and a handful of loyal lieutenants aggressively stripped away dead wood and got quick results
The treatment turned Trelleborg into one of Scandinavia 's biggest and fastest-growing industrial concerns
Between 1985 and 1988 sales multipled more than 10 times and pretax profit surged almost twelvefold
Many analysts expect Mr. Andersson who owns 1.7 % of the company to be named Trelleborg 's new chairman when Ernst Herslow steps down next year
But the promotion is n't likely to alter a management style Mr. Andersson describes as being the driving force leading the troops not managing by sitting back with a cigar waiting for people to bring me ideas
Last month in his boldest move yet Mr. Andersson and Trelleborg joined forces with Canada 's Noranda Inc. in a joint 2 billion hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern Falconbridge Ltd
Industry analysts suggest that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault Trelleborg from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern
Trelleborg is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such as RTZ Corp. or Anglo-American Corp. says Mike Kurtanjek a mining analyst at James Capel & Co. London
But we certainly like what we 've seen so far
But Trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles
Mr. Andersson acknowledges that the company 's mining division will be busy for a while digesting its recent expansion
Booming metals prices have fueled Trelleborg 's recent profit surge raising mining 's share of pretax profit to 68 % this year from a big loss two years earlier
But analysts caution an expected fall in metal prices next year could slow profit growth
Mining is likely to remain Trelleborg 's main business
Analysts say its chances of success will likely hinge on how well Trelleborg manages to cooperate with Noranda in the Falconbridge venture
Noranda and Trelleborg each came close to winning Falconbridge alone before the successful joint bid
Some analysts say Noranda would prefer to break up Falconbridge and that the Swedes relatively inexperienced in international mining operations could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like Noranda operating on its home turf
Mr. Andersson insists that Trelleborg and Noranda have n't discussed a Falconbridge break-up
Falconbridge he says will continue operating in its current form
We 'd be reluctant to accept 50-50 ownership in a manufacturing company
But such partnerships are common in mining where there are n't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner Trelleborg 's president says
Perhaps more important both companies share Mr. Andersson 's belief in the coming renaissance of base industries
If the 1980s were a decade of consumption the '90s will be the investment decade Mr. Andersson says
The whole of Europe and the industrialized world is suffering from a breakdown in infrastructure investment he says
That 's beginning to change
And investment is the key word for base metals and most other businesses Trelleborg is in
Apple Computer Inc. posted improved fiscal fourth-quarter profit due largely to a 48 million gain on the sale of its stock in Adobe Systems Inc
Excluding the gain the company registered a modest 4.6 % increase for the quarter ended Sept. 29 to 113 million or 87 cents a share from the year-earlier 107.9 million or 84 cents a share
Proceeds of the Adobe sale brought net income in the quarter to 161.1 million or 1.24 a share
Apple shares fell 75 cents in over-the-counter trading to close at 48 a share
Fiscal fourth-quarter sales grew about 18 % to 1.38 billion from 1.17 billion a year earlier
Without the Adobe gain Apple 's full-year operating profit edged up 1.5 % to 406 million or 3.16 a share from 400.3 million or 3.08 a share
Including the Adobe gain full-year net was 454 million or 3.53 a share
Sales for the year rose nearly 30 % to 5.28 billion from 4.07 billion a year earlier
John Sculley chairman and chief executive officer credited the Macintosh SE\/30 and IIcx computers introduced in the winter for the brightened sales performance
Mr. Sculley also indicated that sagging margins which dogged the company through most of 1989 began to turn up in the fourth quarter as chip prices eased
Adverse pressure on gross margins has subsided Mr. Sculley said
Margins in the fiscal fourth quarter perked up rising to 51 % from 49.2 % a year earlier
For all of fiscal 1989 however the average gross margin was 49 % below the average 1988 gross margin of 51 %
Lower component costs especially for DRAMs or dynamic random access memory chips were cited for the easing of margin pressure on the company a spokeswoman said
Looking ahead to 1990 Mr. Sculley predicted another year of significant revenue growth along with improved profitability as the recovery in gross margins continues into 1990

Please submit your offers says Felipe Bince Jr
He surveys the prospective investors gathered in the board room of the Philippine government 's Asset Privatization Trust for the sale of a 36 % interest in the country 's largest paper mill
The agency expects the bids to be equivalent of more than 80 million
Not a peso is offered
Mr. Bince the trust 's associate executive trustee declares the bidding a failure
It 's getting harder to sell he mutters as he leaves the room
Indeed
Recently the trust failed to auction off the paper mill a bank an office building and a small cotton-ginning plant
Of the four only the bank and the plant drew bids one apiece
In October 1987 President Corazon Aquino vowed that her government would get out of business by selling all or part of the state 's holdings in the many companies taken over by the government during the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos
Two years later Mrs. Aquino 's promise remains largely unfulfilled
October is a critical month for the privatization program
Manila is offering several major assets for the first time and is trying to conclude sales already arranged
In addition the government is scheduled to unveil plans for privatizing Philippine Airlines the national carrier an effort that lawyer and business columnist Rodolfo Romero calls the bellwether of privatization
All told there are assets on the line valued at up to 1.03 billion
The privatization program is designed to rid the government of hundreds of assets and to raise critically needed funds
Much of the money from the sales is earmarked for a multibillion-dollar agrarian-reform program
But efforts have been thwarted by official indifference bureaucratic resistance a legal system that operates at a snail 's pace political opposition and government misjudgments
Most recently a lack of buyers has been added to the list
Rather than gathering momentum the program is in danger of slowing even more as the government tackles several big assets
The axiom appears to be that the more valuable the asset the harder the privatization process
You just do n't see a whole lot happening says an international economist
To be sure the program has n't completely stalled
The Asset Privatization Trust the agency chiefly responsible for selling government-held properties has recorded sales of more than 500 million since it began functioning in December 1986
But its success has been largely in the sale of small nonperforming companies which are valued for their assets
Dealing with the sales this month could be particularly challenging because almost every problem that has hobbled the program in the past is popping up again
Ramon Garcia the Asset Trust 's executive trustee admits to what he calls temporary setbacks
In light of the poor results recently he says the agency is adopting an attitude of flexibility
October 's troubles began when the trust failed to sell a state-owned commercial bank Associated Bank for the minimum price of 671 million pesos 31 million
At the end of the month the agency again will offer the bank
But instead of a minimum price only a target price will be established
Bankers say however that the government may have difficulty selling the institution even without a floor price
The bank has a negative net worth they say
In addition special bidding rules give the bank 's former owner Leonardo Ty the right to match the highest bid
Mr. Ty lost control to the government in 1980 when a government bank made emergency loans to the cash-strapped institution
In 1983 the loans were converted into equity giving Manila 98 % of the bank but with the understanding that Mr. Ty had repurchase rights
His ability to match any bid has scared off many potential buyers
Separately the government will try again within a month to sell the 36 % stake in Paper Industries Corp. of the Philippines or Picop as the paper mill is known
The price will depend on how much Picop shares fetch on the local stock market
But according to bankers and stock analysts who have studied the paper mill price is n't the only consideration
As it stands now the government would continue to hold 45 % of Picop after the 36 % stake is sold
About 7.5 % of Picop is publicly traded and other shareholders own the rest of the equity
Potential buyers mostly foreign companies are reluctant to take a non-controlling stake in a company that by the government 's own reckoning needs some 100 million in new capital for rehabilitation
The prospect of buying into a cash-hungry company without getting management control persuaded at least three foreign buyers including a member of the Elders group of Australia to pull out of the bidding the bankers and analysts say
Mr. Garcia acknowledges the problem and says the Asset Trust will study why the bidding failed and what changes the agency may be able to offer
Under government regulations however foreign ownership of Picop 's equity is limited to 40 %
Even though the government would retain the 45 % stake in Picop critics have accused the trust of selling out to foreigners
A series of newspaper articles accused the trust of short-changing the government over the Picop sale
Mr. Garcia says he has been notified of congressional hearings on the Picop bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill 's sale both prompted by the criticism of the agency
The question of control could further hinder long-delayed plans for the government to divest itself of Philippine Airlines in which it has a 99 % stake
The carrier has valuable trans-Pacific and Asian routes but it remains debt-laden and poorly managed
This maker of electronic measuring devices named two new directors increasing board membership to nine

Eagle Financial Corp. and Webster Financial Corp. two Connecticut savings bank-holding companies agreed to merge in a tax-free stock transaction
The new holding company Webster\/Eagle Bancorp Inc. will have about 1.2 billion of assets and 19 banking offices in Connecticut
Tangible capital will be about 115 million
The merger is subject to regulatory clearance and a definitive agreement
In the merger each share of Webster based in Waterbury will be converted into one share of the new company
Each share of Eagle based in Bristol will become 0.95 share of Webster\/Eagle
In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday Eagle shares rose 12.5 cents to 11
In national over-the-counter trading Webster shares fell 25 cents to 12.375
Webster has 3.5 million shares outstanding and Eagle 2.6 million
Their indicated market values thus are about 43.3 million and 28.6 million respectively
Frank J. Pascale chairman of Eagle will be chairman of the new firm and James C. Smith president and chief executive officer of Webster will take those posts at Webster\/Eagle
Harold W. Smith Sr. chairman of Webster will become chairman emeritus and a director of the new company
Ralph T. Linsley vice chairman of Eagle will become vice chairman of Webster\/Eagle
The board will be made up of seven directors of each holding company
In an interview James Smith said the banks ' markets are contiguous and their business philosophies are similar and conservative
Nonperforming loans will make up only about 0.5 % of the combined banks ' total loans outstanding he said
At June 30 Webster which owns First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Waterbury had assets of 699 million
Eagle which controls Bristol Federal Savings Bank and First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Torrington had assets of 469.6 million on that date
Guillermo Ortiz 's Sept. 15 Americas column Mexico 's Been Bitten by the Privatization Bug is a refreshingly clear statement of his government 's commitment to privatization and must be welcomed as such by all Americans who wish his country well
The Mexico-United States Institute is glad to see such a high official as Mexico 's undersecretary of finance view his country 's reforms in the context of a larger world-wide process of profound change toward free-market economics especially in the statist countries
Having said that we must caution against an apparent tendency to overstate the case
It is not quite true for example that the Mexican government has privatized Mexicana de Aviacion as Mr. Ortiz claims
In the same sentence he contradicts himself when he reports that the government still retains 40 % of the total equity of the airline
How can a company be considered privatized if the state is so heavily represented in it True the Mexican government has granted control over the airline to a new private consortium but its propensity to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be sanguine
Regrettably too Mr. Ortiz resorts to the familiar numbers game when he boasts that fewer than 392 state enterprises currently remain in the public sector down from the 1,155 public entities that existed in 1982
But the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in Mexico indeed they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure
I refer essentially to petroleum electric power banking and newsprint
Those enterprises however are not going to be privatized
They are officially considered strategic and their privatization is prohibited by the Mexican Constitution
In language that sidesteps the issue Mr. Ortiz writes The divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of President Carlos Salinas 's plan to modernize Mexico 's economy
Yet clearly modernization must embrace its key industries before it can be said to have caught the privatization bug
The bottom line however is not economic but political reform
A long succession of Mexican presidents arbitrarily nationalized whatever industry they took a fancy to without having to answer to the public
To guarantee that Mexicana de Aviacion and other companies will really be privatized Mexico needs a pluri-party political system that will ensure democracy and hence accountability
Daniel James President Mexico-United States Institute The board of this Ponce Puerto Rico concern voted to suspend payment of its quarterly of 11 cents a share for the third quarter
The third-largest thrift institution in Puerto Rico also said it expects a return to profitability in the third quarter when it reports operating results this week
Ponce Federal said the dividend was suspended in anticipation of more stringent capital requirements under the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989
A labor-management group is preparing a revised buy-out bid for United Airlines parent UAL Corp. that would transfer majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands according to people familiar with the group
The group has been discussing a proposal valued in a range of 225 to 240 a share or 5.09 billion to 5.42 billion
But to avoid the risk of rejection the group does n't plan to submit the plan formally at a UAL board meeting today
Instead the group is raising the proposal informally to try to test the board 's reaction
People familiar with the company say the board is n't likely to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the 300-a-share 6.79 billion buy-out bid that collapsed last week after banks would n't raise needed loans and after a key partner British Airways PLC dropped out
In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange UAL closed at 168.50 a share down 21.625
But the pilots union which has been pushing for a takeover since 1987 appears to be pressing ahead with the revised bid to avoid further loss of momentum even though it has n't found a partner to replace British Air
Although the bidding group has n't had time to develop its latest idea fully or to discuss it with banks it believes bank financing could be obtained
After the collapse of the last effort the group does n't plan to make any formal proposal without binding commitments from banks covering the entire amount to be borrowed
Under the type of transaction being discussed the pilot-management group would borrow several billion dollars from banks that could then be used to finance a cash payment to current holders
Those current holders would also receive minority interests in the new company
For example the group could offer 200 a share in cash plus stock valued at 30 a share
UAL currently has 22.6 million shares fully diluted
The new structure would be similar to a recapitalization in which holders get a special dividend yet retain a controlling ownership interest
The difference is that current holders would n't retain majority ownership or control
The failed takeover would have given UAL employees 75 % voting control of the nation 's second-largest airline with management getting 10 % control and British Air 15 %
It was n't clear how the ownership would stack up under the new plan but employees would keep more than 50 %
Management 's total could be reduced and the public could get more than the 15 % control that had been earmarked for British Air
One option the board is likely to consider today is some sort of cooling-off period
Although the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort at least temporarily and to return to running the company full time
The board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can be ousted by a majority shareholder vote particularly since one-third of UAL stock is held by takeover stock speculators who favor a sale
The labor-management buy-out group plans to keep its offer on the table in an apparent attempt to maintain its bargaining position with the board
However the only outsider who has emerged to lead such a shareholder vote Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis who triggered the buy-out with a 5.4 billion bid in early August is hanging back apparently to avoid being blamed for contributing to the deal 's collapse
Three top advisers to Mr. Davis visited New York late last week at least in part to confer with executives at Citicorp
Mr. Davis had paid 6 million for Citicorp 's backing of his last bid
But Citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group
On Friday British Air issued a statement saying it does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of UAL in the foreseeable future
However several people said that British Air might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from British regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the UAL buy-out
Also late last week UAL flight attendants agreed to participate with the pilots in crafting a revised offer
But the machinists union whose opposition helped scuttle the first buy-out bid is likely to favor a recapitalization with a friendly third-party investor
One advantage the buy-out group intends to press with the board is that pilots have agreed to make 200 million in annual cost concessions to help finance a bid
Speculation has also arisen that the UAL executive most closely identified with the failure to gain bank financing chief financial officer John Pope may come under pressure to resign
However people familiar with the buy-out group said Mr. Pope 's departure would weaken the airline 's management at a critical time
Despite the buy-out group 's failure to obtain financing UAL remains obligated to pay 26.7 million in investment banking and legal fees to the group 's advisers Lazard Freres & Co. Salomon Brothers Inc. and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison

A REVISED BID FOR UAL is being prepared by a labor-management group sources said
The new proposal which would transfer majority ownership of United Air 's parent to employees and leave some stock in public hands would be valued at 225 to 240 a share or as much as 5.42 billion

Inmac Corp. a money-losing direct marketer of computer supplies and accessories said directors suspended payment of its semiannual dividend as too great a drain on funds
The company paid five cents a share in April
The directors ' action taken Oct. 10 but announced Friday had little or no effect on the company 's stock which stagnated at 4.75 in light over-the-counter trading
Inmac recently disclosed a 12.3 million write-off related to a corporate restructuring that resulted in the company 's posting a 6.4 million net loss for the year ended July 29 compared with year-earlier profit of 9.7 million or 1.02 a share
Sales rose 12 % to 249.5 million from 222.8 million
The board felt that the continued payment of our semiannual dividend was inconsistent with recent operating results said Kenneth A. Eldred president and chief executive officer

The Food and Drug Administration said American Home Products Corp. agreed to recall certain generic drugs that were produced by its Quantum Pharmics unit in Amityville N.Y
Quantum stopped shipping the drugs last month following a federal investigation regarding information the company supplied to obtain three drug approvals
The FDA requested the recall of Quantum 's mioxidil tablets chlorazepate dipotassium tablets and meclofenamate sodium capsules because it said the size of the production runs submitted for testing to gain FDA approval was in each case misrepresented as much larger than it actually was
American Home Products based in New York agreed to recall four other products trazadone doxepin diazepam and lorazapam because of concerns about data submitted in their original approval applications before the FDA
No safety problems with the products are known the FDA said
An FDA spokesperson said the drugs are still available under other brand names
Last month American Home Products said it was suspending production and distribution of all 21 of Quantum 's generic drug products pending the completion of an exhaustive internal audit
It also temporarily closed Quantum because of the internal investigation as well as the FDA 's ongoing inquiry
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading American Home Products rose 75 cents to 105 on Friday
Lyondell Petrochemical Co. said third-quarter net income fell 54 % to 73 million or 91 cents a share from 160 million a year earlier
Year-earlier per-share results are n't applicable because the company went public in January
Revenue rose 7.7 % to 1.28 billion from 1.18 billion
The petrochemical maker said the biggest reason earnings declined was a loss of production time and the increased costs associated with a temporary maintenance closing and expansion of an olefins plant
Like other refiners Lyondell 's margins for chemicals and gasoline were narrower
While the company said chemical margins continued to worsen this quarter costs will be lower because the maintenance and expansions are complete
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday Lyondell was unchanged at 18.50 a share
Four former Cordis Corp. officials were acquitted of federal charges related to the Miami-based company 's sale of pacemakers including conspiracy to hide pacemaker defects

In East Germany where humor has long been the only way to express political criticism they 're not laughing about their new leader Egon Krenz
Mr. Krenz is such a contradictory figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about him
You have to have clear feelings about someone before you can make jokes says an East German mother of two who loves swapping political barbs with her friends
With Krenz we just do n't know what to expect
Mr. Krenz does n't seem to be the knee-jerk hardliner many initially thought he was when the 52-year-old Politburo member was selected last week to succeed Erich Honecker
But he does n't appear to be ready to make broad changes either
According to East Germany 's ADN news agency Mr. Krenz spoke to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged East Germany could learn from Moscow 's glasnost policies
Already last week Mr. Krenz started overhauling East Germany 's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media
On Thursday a day after he took office East German television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions for a panel of officials to answer
The regular nightly news program and daily newspapers are also getting a visible injection of Soviet-style glasnost
It was quite a shock says a 43-year-old East German shopkeeper
For the first time in my life I was n't sure whether I was listening to our news or West German television
Other changes including easing restrictions on travel for East Germans are expected
But whether such moves can win back the confidence of East Germans who have taken to the streets by the thousands in recent weeks to demand democratic changes depends largely on whether they feel they can trust Mr. Krenz
And that 's a problem
Mr. Krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor Mr. Honecker but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising China for sending tanks against student demonstrators
I hope he grows with the job says Rainer Eppelmann a Protestant pastor in East Berlin
The most important thing is that he have a chance
Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades
Unlike Mr. Honecker who tended to lecture people about socialist values Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions
Indeed one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers a la Gorbachev
He was later shown on television fielding questions
At one point he asked a worker whether he thought East Germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies
The worker 's tart reply It 's more than just travel
People have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society
The exchange was all the more remarkable in that authorities released television footage to Western news agencies
This same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting U.S. congressmen this spring
Rather than trying to lecture us says one congressional aide who attended the two-hour meeting Mr. Krenz wanted to listen
Rep. Ronnie Flippo D. Ala. one of the members of the delegation says he was particularly impressed by Mr. Krenz 's ready admission that East Germany needed to change
He 's a very tough man but one who 's also open to arguments adds an aide to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
But there 's another side to Mr. Krenz
Born in a Baltic town in an area which is now part of Poland he has dedicated his life to the party apparatus
He moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his patron Mr. Honecker and emerged as the heir apparent
Barbara Donovan an expert on East Germany at Radio Free Europe in Munich says Mr. Krenz may project a smooth image but she doubts he 's a true reformer
Even if he is she adds he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the Communist Party 's ruling Politburo
Against this background the new East German leader must move quickly to shore up his government 's standing
The sudden growth of the opposition movement together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through Poland and Hungary has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an anti-Soviet workers ' uprising in 1953
He does n't have any honeymoon period says a Western diplomat based in East Berlin
But if he 's sharp and quick he has a chance
The diplomat adds that Mr. Krenz has several things going for him
The East German economy is strong compared with other East bloc nations
And his relative youth could help him project a more vibrant image contrasting with the perception of Mr. Honecker as an out-of-touch old man
For average East Germans Mr. Krenz remains a puzzle
Either he was n't being real in the past or he is n't being real right now says a 30-year-old East German doctor
Either way I have a problem with how quickly he 's changed
The doctor was among dozens of people milling through East Berlin 's Gethsemane Church Saturday morning
The walls of the church are covered with leaflets news clippings and handwritten notes associated with the country 's political opposition
I have to come here to read the walls says the doctor because it 's information I still ca n't get through the newspapers
Meanwhile East Germany 's growing openness may even allow the state-controlled news media to display a muted sense of humor
Television last week carried a new report on East Berlin 's main wallpaper factory and the need to boost production
East Germans remember a comment a few years ago by Kurt Hager the government 's top ideologist that just because a neighbor hangs new wallpaper there 's no reason to change your own
His point was there is no reason for East Germany to copy Soviet-style changes
It 's hard to know whether it was intended to be funny says the East Berlin shopkeeper But everyone I know laughed about it
The list of laboratories claiming to be producing inexplicable amounts of heat from cold fusion experiments is slowly growing
But the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms
New experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions leaving only the finding of tritium in a Texas experiment to support University of Utah chemists ' claim of achieving hydrogen fusion at room temperatures
The latest developments in cold fusion research were presented in 24 reports delivered at the fall meeting here of the Electrochemical Society the first scientific meeting in five months to hear formal reports on cold fusion experiments
The meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research
Of the 1,300 chemists registered for the society 's weeklong meeting fewer than 200 sat through the day and a half of cold fusion presentations at week 's end
This was in contrast with the society 's meeting last May at the height of the controversy when more than 1,500 scientists along with scores of reporters and TV crews crowded into a Los Angeles hotel ballroom for a tumultuous special night session on the subject
Neither of the two chemists whose Utah experiments triggered the cold fusion uproar Martin Fleischmann and B. Stanley Pons were at the meeting
But some members of an ad hoc expert committee set up by the Department of Energy to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience
The committee is to recommend at the end of the month whether DOE should support cold fusion research
Most of the two dozen scientists taking the podium reported results with new more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple electrolysis-of-water experiments described last March by Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons
The experiments involve encircling a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two electrodes into heavy water in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium
When an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum electrodes the heavy water did begin to break up or dissociate
Ordinarily the electrolysis or breakup of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy
But Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons said their experiments also produced large amounts of heat
The heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in they reported
Because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation they asserted that the excess heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod
As of last weekend a dozen labs also have reported measuring excess heat from similar electrolytic experiments although amounts of such heat vary widely
One of the seven reports presented here of excess heat production was given by Richard A. Oriani professor of chemical engineering at the University of Minnesota
Mr. Oriani said his skepticism of the Utah claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to produce results
But he then borrowed a palladium rod from chemists at Texas A&M who said they were getting excess heat
The results were fascinating he said
On the fourth run with the borrowed rod the experiment began producing excess heat
The experiment was stopped briefly to change an instrument
When it was restarted heat output really took off and produced excess heat for several hours before dying down he said
Typical of other experiments Mr. Oriani said his experiment was very erratic
It would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times it would begin producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before quieting down
The excess heat was 15 % to 20 % more than the energy involved in the electrolysis of water
Mr. Oriani said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' quiescent times as some scientists have suggested
There is a reality to the excess energy he said
Other scientists said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time
The bursts often occur they said after they perturbed the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied or switching the current off and on
One chemist privately suggested this hinted that some anomalous chemical reactions might be producing the heat
One reason questions surround the heat experiments is that they involve unusually meticulous measurements
Typically the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenths of a watt
One exception is a continuing experiment at Stanford University where as much as 10 watts of energy are being put into the electrolytic cells
A cell filled with heavy water is producing 1.0 to 1.5 watts more heat than an identical electrolytic cell filled with ordinary water next to it reported Turgut M. Gur an associate of materials scientist Robert A. Huggins head of the Stanford experimental team
One of the few hints the excess heat might be produced by fusion came from brief remarks by chemist John Bockris of Texas A&M University
Mr. Bockris previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of detecting increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water
He said that within the past few days he 's gotten evidence that there is a weak correlation between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium
There is n't any way to continuously measure the amount of tritium in the heavy water so it 's been difficult to tell whether the tritium formation is related to the heat bursts or some other phenomenon
Increasingly careful attempts to measure neutrons which would be strong evidence of fusion reactions continue to be negative
Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable
Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque N.M. reported they went so far as to take a cold fusion experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays
A number of times they detected neutrons in one sometimes two of the three detectors but only once during 411 hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors and they think that was a spurious event
Shimson Gottesfeld of Los Alamos National Laboratory said researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last April but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it
In subsequent experiments one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time
They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment
At the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California new experiments indicated that the lithium added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can produce previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod which Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons might have misinterpreted reported Philip Ross from the California laboratory

Reflecting the impact of lower semiconductor prices and cuts in defense spending Texas Instruments Inc. said third-quarter net income fell 31 % and sales dropped slightly from a year earlier
Net fell to 65 million or 67 cents a common share from 93.7 million or 1.03 a share a year ago
Sales fell 2.5 % to 1.54 billion from 1.58 billion
For the nine months the electronics and defense concern had net of 255.8 million or 2.70 a share down 5.6 % from 271 million or 3.01 a share in the year-ago period
Sales were 4.66 billion up 1.3 % from 4.6 billion
Jerry Junkins chairman president and chief executive officer said sluggish consumer-electronics sales reduced demand for semiconductors
That coupled with lower semiconductor prices and higher semiconductor-depreciation expense contributed to the decline in sales and profit
In addition cost increases related to fixed-price defense contracts and a 10 million charge to reduce the work force of Texas Instruments ' defense-electronics division also reduced net
However the quarter results included 28 million in royalty income from patent licenses up from 21 million in the year-earlier period
The nine months include 125 million of royalty income up from 98 million last year
Mr. Junkins was n't optimistic about the short-term outlook hinting that further workforce reductions may be needed
We expect near-term sluggishness in the electronics market he said and we will take ongoing cost-reduction actions as necessary to keep operations aligned with demand
Further he said an internal reorganization to combine several divisions into the Information Technology Group is expected to affect fourth-quarter results by an undisclosed amount
Lynch Corp. said its Lynch Telephone Corp. subsidiary completed the acquisition of Western New Mexico Telephone Co. for 20 million plus assumption of 24 million of debt
Western New Mexico Telephone Silver City had net income of 1.9 million on revenue of about 10 million last year
It is an independent phone company with a service area of 15,000 square miles in southwest New Mexico
It is also a partner in the wireline cellular franchise covering most of western New Mexico
The transaction represents Lynch 's entry into the telephone business
The company which has interests in television trucking services and glass-making and food-processing equipment said it plans to make other acquisitions in the telephone industry
Nelson Bunker Hunt 's attempted corner on silver a decade ago is still haunting the market in this metal
Silver now trading around 5 an ounce surged to an all-time peak of 50 an ounce in January 1980 from around 9 in mid-1979
Mr. Hunt 's attempt to squeeze the silver market 10 years ago is still indirectly to blame for today 's market depression says Lesley Edgar managing director of Sharps Pixley Ltd. London bullion brokers
While some 100 million ounces of silver once held by Mr. Hunt and Middle Eastern associates are n't hanging over the market anymore the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use Mr. Edgar says
Photographic developers for example bought equipment to recover silver from spent photographs negatives and processing solutions
Meanwhile the photographic industry which accounts for 44 % of silver consumption continues to look for substitutes
Japanese and U.S. photographic firms are beginning to produce electronic cameras and X-rays that do n't require silver dealers say
Silver 's history of volatility is also discouraging investors dealers say
Even in the present uncertain investment climate investors are preferring quality assets such as Treasury bills and bonds to gold silver and platinum dealers say
Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation dealers say
Silver however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum
Some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last seen in the mid-1970s
Bargain hunters believe that silver offers the best value amongst precious metals says Frederick R. Demler analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc
A further decline in prices will lead to mine production cuts in the U.S. he says
Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver while low prices are discouraging exports from India and the Soviet Union
Silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations Peru and Mexico Mr. Demler says
Meanwhile total fabrication demand for silver has risen six years in a row he says
Japanese demand grew by 70 % in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require 4.5 million ounces
Compared with huge annual surpluses of more than 100 million ounces in the first half of the 1980s world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance Mr. Demler says
Despite intermittent rallies in the past few years improvements in the supply-demand balance have n't managed to push silver prices into a higher range
There 's just too much silver around says Tom Butler an analyst at Samuel Montagu & Co. a London bullion house
A huge silver stockpile at exchanges refiners consuming industries and government warehouses of at least 617 million ounces is the market depressant says Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in a report
This year alone inventories at the Commodity Exchange of New York jumped by a staggering 46 million to 221 million ounces because of producer deliveries de-stocking by fabricators and sales by disenchanted investors says Rhona O'Connell London-based precious metals analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Silver production is also in an inexorable upward trend Ms. O'Connell says
Moreover while Asian and Middle Eastern investors hoard gold and help underpin its price silver does n't have the same mystique dealers say
Investors have gotten burned on silver so often that they are far more partial to gold says Urs Seiler senior vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland
Yet if gold prices improve silver prices could rally sharply he says
However dealers caution that any increase would be 1 to 2 at most
Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week Livestock and Meats Analysts expect the prices of live cattle futures contracts to rise in trading today in the wake of a government quarterly census that found fewer-than-expected cattle on feedlots
After the close of trading Friday the Agriculture Department reported that feedlots in the 13 biggest ranch states held 8.06 million cattle on Oct. 1 down 6 % from that date a year earlier
Most analysts had expected the government to report a 4 % decline
Feedlots fatten young cattle for slaughter so a decline signals a tightening supply of beef
The government reported that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter dropped 5 % compared with the year-earlier quarter
Many industry analysts had been projecting a 3 % decline in placements for the quarter
In the 1988 quarter many farmers were forced to sell their cattle to feedlot operators because the drought dried out the pasture on their ranches
The number of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because fattening cattle is less profitable
A shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for feedlot operators to buy
The Agriculture Department also said that the number of fattened cattle slaughtered in the quarter dropped by 5 % from the 1988 quarter which was in line with projections by analysts
Energy Friday 's 44-cent-a-barrel price drop to 19.98 in the expiring November contract for West Texas Intermediate crude may well set the tone for trading this week in petroleum futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange
Most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract 's going off the board
Others said that the drop continued the downward correction that 's been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions
Barring any petroleum-related news events trading in the days ahead should further test recent projections by oil economists and other market watchers that strong fourth-quarter demand will keep prices firm
Copper Copper prices fell sharply Friday afternoon
For example copper for December delivery settled 4.5 cents lower at 1.2345 a pound
Pressure came from several developments including the settlement of two long-term strikes
On Friday one analyst said rank-and-file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia
In Mexico the analyst added employees at the Cananea mine who have been out of work since late August when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government accepted a 35 % cut in the 3,800-man work force
The mine is expected to return to production in about a week
On Friday selling dominated the afternoon curb session in London which takes place at noon EDT
The premium of cash copper to the three-month forward offerings narrowed indicating weaker demand for cash copper
Long-term support for the December contract was believed to be at 1.25 a pound
A technical analyst said there were a number of stop-loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract 's price fell below it
That brought in considerable fund selling which continued until the close of trading
In general it was a bearish close said Ben Hanauer a copper trader at Rudolph Wolff & Co. a major commodities trading and brokerage firm
But whether this price break has implications for this week he said we will know more when the London Metal Exchange copper stock levels are released Monday morning
Another analyst said he expected LME inventories to be down by about 15,000 tons when the weekly report is issued
Bernard Savaiko senior commodities analyst at PaineWebber Inc. said that when traders saw the market was n't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower LME stocks they perceived a bearish sign
He also noted that the Japanese who had been buying at prices just above the 1.25 level apparently pulled back from the market on Friday
Mr. Savaiko said he sees a possibility of the December contract dropping to 1.05 a pound
Hewlett-Packard Co. will announce today a software program that allows computers in a network to speed up computing tasks by sending the tasks to each other
Called Task Broker the program acts something like an auctioneer among a group of computers wired together
If a machine has a big computing task Task Broker asks other computers in the network for bids on the job
It then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine
Hewlett-Packard claims that the software allows a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast
The new Hewlett-Packard program said analyst John McCarthy at Forrester Research Inc. a computer-market research company is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing
In today 's computer networks some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed
With the Hewlett-Packard program he said You get more bang for the buck you 've spent on computers
The program which will be shipped in January 1990 runs on the Unix operating system
Hewlett-Packard will charge 5,000 for a license covering 10 users
The program now works on all Hewlett-Packard and Apollo workstations and on computers made by Multiflow Computer Inc. of Branford Conn
Hewlett-Packard said it will sell versions later next year that run on Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp. machines
The Task Broker differs from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network
A previously available program called Network Computing System developed by Hewlett-Packard 's Apollo division for instance takes a task and splits it up into parts divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing
But programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system
Applications wo n't have to be rewritten to work with Task Broker Hewlett-Packard said and the user of a computer wo n't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work
The Task Broker turns that network into as far as the user is concerned one giant computer said Bill Kay general manager of Hewlett-Packard 's workstation group
Price wars between the fast-food giants are starting to clobber the fast-food little guys the franchisees
When elephants start fighting ants get killed says Murray Riese co-owner of National Restaurants a New York franchisee for Pizza Hut Roy Rogers and other chains
As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another franchisers are struggling desperately for market share slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions
The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees
The chains used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow but in the last year or so discounting has become a 12-month thing says Donald Harty president of Charisma Group Inc. a New York franchisee of Grand Metropolitan PLC 's Burger King chain
Though Charisma 's sales are up slightly this year Mr. Harty says profits will be flat or lower
And Bill Konopnicki a Safford Ariz. licensee of McDonald 's Corp. who is chairman of the company 's National Operators Advisory Board says some fast-food outlets could be in serious trouble based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on
Until recently the huge fast-food industry with sales of about 60.1 billion last year kept price-skirmishing to a minimum
But early this year PepsiCo Inc. 's Taco Bell unit and Wendy 's International Inc. slashed prices and stepped up promotions says John Rohs an analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Co
That brought a chain reaction in the industry
The situation was further aggravated early this month when McDonald 's set plans to heat up the discounting by offering coupons
It also decided to go national with pizza which it has been test-marketing
Now two-for-one deals on pizza are common so are 99-cent specials on sandwiches normally priced twice as high
The discounting say fast-food operators occurs on a scale and with a frequency they have n't seen before
The result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even laying off middle managers and working harder to make less
Joe Mack a district manager for Cormack Enterprises Inc. a Burger King operator in Omaha Neb. says discounting is so prevalent that we have to serve 15 % to 20 % more customers to keep sales level
It 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food he says
Alan D'Agosto president of Panda 's Inc. an operator of Arby 's restaurants in Omaha says All we 're doing is keeping the customers coming but we are n't increasing sales
With fast-food outlets on every corner he like many does n't think he has a choice in the price war Our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon
If the battle continues much longer many fast-food businesses will close or merge predicts Vincent Morrissey who owns a string of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the Midwest
The industry is overbuilt he says
Fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available
The National Restaurant Association says quick-service restaurant units in the U.S. rose 14 % to 131,146 between 1983 and 1987 the last year for which figures are available
With the market so crowded says a spokesman for Wendy 's in Columbus Ohio If you 're doing well you 're doing well at someone else 's expense
Simply put there is n't enough business for every store to grow
According to Mr. Rohs inflation-adjusted same-store sales at company-owned Wendy 's units in the U.S. have trailed year-earlier levels throughout 1989 except for August
McDonald 's has also been running negative all year the analyst says
Spokesmen for Wendy 's and McDonald 's criticized Mr. Rohs 's calculations
Jack Greenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer of McDonald 's says the company does n't compute much less disclose inflation-adjusted same-store sales
He adds that short-term comparisons can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year
Profit margins at company-owned McDonald 's outlets in the U.S. are holding up quite nicely says Mr. Greenberg
Profits of franchisees have n't been higher since the mid-1970s he adds
But Mr. Greenberg 's sanguine outlook is n't matched by many fast-food industry observers
Smaller chains and single-store operators will be the first to fail many in the industry predict
Big franchise groups can ride out the storm a lot longer says Mr. Harty the Burger King operator in New York
The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees
Mr. Morrissey the Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties or portion of sales that they must pay franchisers
Franchisees ca n't be forced to go along with a franchiser 's discounting
But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end says Lew Rudnick a principal of Rudnick & Wolfe a Chicago law firm with franchise industry clients
He says courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing
In any case many franchisees in order to stay on good terms with franchisers routinely go along with promotions
Says Mr. Riese of National Restaurants If you resisted on prices maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise

CalMat Co. said it completed a 32.8 million sale of assets from its Los Angeles area real estate portfolio for net income of 12 million
CalMat said the sale is part of its previously announced plan to sell much of its real estate holdings to focus on its core business of mining and producing asphalt concrete rock and sand
And you thought the only reason to save your canceled checks was to prepare for an IRS audit
Reggie Jackson the retired baseball star has found another use for them
Mr. Jackson who won the nickname Mr. October for his World Series exploits is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as 500 each
Dealers say the budding trade in Mr. Jackson 's canceled checks is unusual
I do n't know of any living ballplayer that 's ever done it says Jack Smalling a dealer in Ames Iowa and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs
An initial batch of Mr. Jackson 's checks was on sale at a baseball-card show held in San Francisco over Labor Day weekend
Mr. Jackson showed up at the affair to sign autographs for a fee as well
For someone who has everything else Reggie 's jersey cap and cards his checks might be a nice addition says William Vizas owner of Bill 's Sports Collectibles in Denver who examined the checks at the San Francisco card show
For years the canceled checks of a small number of well-known baseball players have been bought and sold
But these players were dead
Maybe three years ago there were a lot of Ty Cobbs in the hobby and awhile back there were Babe Ruth checks says Mr. Smalling
However the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way
Maybe I 'm a little stuffy but I would n't sell them sniffs Bob Machon owner of Papa 's Sports Cards in Menlo Park Calif
Who knows how much they 'll be worth 100 years from now And Mr. Smalling does n't believe they 're worth all that much now
I do n't think the checks are worth 15 apiece he says
Why Mr. Jackson who could n't be reached for comment has made some of his checks available for sale is n't clear
He probably has n't done it for the cash
I would say he 's definitely not in need of money says Matt Merola an agent of Mr. Jackson 's based in New York
He has good investments
And Mr. Jackson probably has opened new checking accounts too
Or at least he should
I assume those accounts are closed says Mr. Smalling referring to the accounts of the canceled checks
I do n't think he 'd want to give out his current account numbers
USX Corp. and its Japanese partner Kobe Steel Ltd. agreed to form a joint venture to build a new plant to produce hot-dipped galvanized sheet products mainly for the automotive market
Terms were n't disclosed for the plant which will have annual capacity of 600,000 tons
The move by the nation 's largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies
Bethlehem Steel Corp. LTV Corp. and Armco Inc. all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion-resistant steel
The surge in production analysts say raises questions about capacity outpacing demand
They note that most of the new plants will come on line in 1992 when the current import trade restraint program ends which could result in more imports
There 's too much capacity contended Charles Bradford an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
I do n't think there 's anyone not building one
He does add however that transplanted Japanese car makers are boosting the levels of U.S.-made steel in their autos instead of relying heavily on imported steel
That trend could increase demand for hot-dipped galvanized sheet
The hot-dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest-growing and most profitable segments of the steel market coveted by all major integrated steelmakers wanting to maintain an edge over smaller minimills and reconstructed mills those spun off to employees
Indeed USX said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by 1992 compared with 10.2 million tons shipped in 1988
For the first eight months of 1989 analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about 8 % from a year earlier while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4 %
USX and Kobe Steel hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992
USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel but this marks the first so-called greenfield plant for such production
Moreover it will boost by 50 % USX 's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons
The company said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to adversely affect the company 's existing hot-dipped galvanizing lines
Steelmakers have also been adding capacity of so-called electrogalvanized steel which is another way to make coated corrosion-resistant steel
One of the advantages of the hot-dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a thicker coat of zinc more quickly
ONCE YOU MAKE UP your mind about an investment the rest is easy right You just call your broker and say buy or sell
Dream on
There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker and just as many ways to get burned if you do n't know what you 're doing
So here 's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges
Two things to keep in mind Not all exchanges accept every type of order
And even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer
Market Order This is probably the most widely used order and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers since it imposes no price restrictions
With a market order an investor tells a broker to buy or sell at the market
It 's like saying get me in now or get me out now
For example if wheat is being offered at 4.065 and bid at 4.060 a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price
A recent indictment alleges that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers
Profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers
Limit Order Limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment
Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it
Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock but not for less than 55
A limit order to sell could be entered at that price
One risk Investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches 54 and then falls
Unless the market goes at least one tick the smallest price increment permitted beyond the limit price investors are n't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price
Stop Order Stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level
Once the price reaches that level a stop order turns into a market order and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get
Stop orders are sometimes called stop-loss orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses
While stop orders sound similar to limit orders there is a difference Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above
In contrast sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below
The crash in October 1987 and last Friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do
An investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at 90 under a stock that was trading at 100 a share on the Friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at 75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday
Stop-Limit Order Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order
Unlike stop orders which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price
If it ca n't be made at that price it does n't get filled
Investors who wish to be out of a position without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled
But if the market moves quickly enough it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price
Market-If-Touched Order Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached
However unlike a buy-stop order a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it
As soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price
Fill-Or-Kill Order The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades
It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better
But if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately the order is automatically canceled
Gregory Bessemer who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed U.S. Trading Championship says he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options
I like to use them to feel out the market he says
If they do n't fill it immediately then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price
Not-Held Order This is another timing order
It is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment if they think they can get a better price by waiting
Not-held orders which are also known as disregard the tape orders are always done at the customer 's risk
One-Cancels-The-Other Order This is really two orders in one generally for the same security or commodity instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order
In a fast-moving market it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security
Specific-Time Order This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time
On the close can be added to many types of orders
For example market-on-close orders must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange
Stop-close-only orders are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading
Day orders expire at the end of the day on which they are entered good-till-canceled orders have no expiration date
Most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise
On Oct. 19 1987 some investors learned the consequences of entering good-til-canceled limit orders and then forgetting about them
They found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel
It is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed
Investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are usually stuck with the consequences
Mr. Angrist writes on the options and commodities markets for The Wall Street Journal
IN SIZING UP the risks of stock-market investments there 's probably no starting place better than beta
But investors better not ignore its limitations either
Beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund
For any given move in the overall market it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall
Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret
The beta of the broad market typically defined as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index is always 1.0
So a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile one at 1.5 is 50 % more volatile and so on
Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas
Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market
Remember though that beta also has important limitations
Beta is only part of the risk in a stock says William F. Sharpe the Stanford University emeritus professor who developed the measure
There is risk that is not associated with market moves and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that
In particular beta does n't measure the company and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock
That business risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks but it virtually disappears in a large and well-diversified portfolio
Beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer
In particular the prices of gold and other precious-metals stocks shoot up and down but the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market-inspired
Concern that investors could misinterpret such readings led the American Association of Individual Investors to eliminate beta figures for precious-metals funds in the 1989 edition of its mutual-fund guide
Our fear was people would look just at the beta of a gold fund and say here is an investment with very low risk says John Markese director of research for the Chicago-based group
In reality it 's very volatile but the movements are not because of market movements
READY TO REVIEW the riskiness of your investment portfolio First a pop quiz
When you think of the words risk and investment what 's the specific peril that comes to mind Pencils down
If you 're like most people you said it 's a holding that goes completely sour maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding
People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension says Timothy Kochis national director of personal financial planning for accountants Deloitte Haskins & Sells
But therein lies another aspect of investment risk the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others
This is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs
Risk wears many disguises and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other less obvious kinds
U.S. Treasury bonds for example are supersafe when it comes to returning money at maturity
But their value as investments can be decimated by inflation which erodes the purchasing power of bonds ' fixed-dollar interest payments
Risk is also a function of time
When financial professionals measure risk mathematically they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns
Stocks are much riskier than Treasury bills for example because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider
That is usually measured by the standard deviation or divergence of annual results from the average return over time
But investors who are preoccupied with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and life-style goals
For instance some investors have sworn off stocks since the 1987 market crash last Friday 's debacle only reinforced those feelings
But the stock market despite some stomach-churning declines has far outperformed other securities over extended periods
By retreating to the apparent security of say money-market funds investors may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement
That 's the biggest risk of all the risk of not meeting your objectives says Steven B. Enright a New York financial planner with Seidman Financial Services
As a result financial advisers say they take several steps when evaluating the riskiness of clients ' portfolios
They estimate the return a person 's current portfolio is likely to generate over time along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year
They try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals
And they eyeball types of risk that are not easily quantified
The portfolios of two hypothetical families one a couple at retirement age and another a two-income couple at age 45 illustrate several types of risk that investors need to consider
For instance the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk
But they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk
The younger couple 's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue
Note that the younger couple 's portfolio has a higher expected annual return 10.1 % vs. 8.8 % as calculated by Seidman Financial Services which is the financial-planning affiliate of BDO Seidman
That largely reflects the heavy stockholdings
But one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility as reflected in the higher standard deviation that Seidman estimates for the younger couple 's portfolio
Here 's how to interpret a standard deviation figure Take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it
Then take the expected return and subtract one standard deviation
In two of three years the actual result should fall within that range if all the assumptions were accurate
Then add and subtract two standard deviations to get a wider range
There 's a 95 % probability any year 's result will fall in the range
Of course the greater volatility of the younger couple 's portfolio does n't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders ' long-term goals
Indeed the older couple 's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans
They may feel emotionally secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market says John H. Cammack a financial planner with Alexandra Armstrong Advisors Inc. in Washington
But they may pay a price 10 or 20 years in the future
Ms. Slater reports on personal finance from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau
When it comes to investing trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing darts blindfolded Investors do n't know the actual returns that securities will deliver or the ups and downs that will occur along the way
Looking to the past can provide some clues
Over several decades for instance investors who put up with the stock market 's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and cash investments like Treasury bills
But while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there 's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself
For instance some analysts believe bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market
And returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past

A letter from Senator John Kerry chides us today for implying that he had flip-flopped on Manuel Noriega
He correctly says he has been down on Noriega for some time hence his criticism of administration mishandling of the attempted coup
Our October 12 editorial should have been more precise
It meant to convey our hope that the Senator and other members of the congressional left are broadening their dislike of Noriega to include other notorious Central American drug runners
The Sandinistas of Nicaragua for example also are part of the Castro-Medellin cartel nexus
In his letter and on the basis of his losing vote Tuesday against U.S. aid for the Nicaraguan opposition Senator Kerry makes clear he has not made that intellectual leap
We were wrong
THROUGHOUT THE 1980s investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional modes of financial planning
Capital has been democratized and people want in
Too often however small investors are left with the same stale solutions that appealed to previous generations of fiduciary strategists
Now a startling new approach is available to building your financial portfolio without undue risk without extensive planning and without hurting your life style one bit This is particularly good news for those who hate risk who are incapable of doing extensive amounts of planning and who refuse to see their life styles hurt in any way
You know who you are
My revolutionary system is also useful for those who have tried customary forms of growing their currency cushion
Like all Americans seeking chronic prosperity I do find it necessary to plunge certain funds into conservative monetary tools if only to assuage my father-in-law who believes in such things
So throughout the decade I have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and CDs and tinkered with stocks bonds and mutual funds as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market
Return on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative
Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses I 've invested in during this prosperous decade see accompanying illustration WSJ Oct. 20 1989
Oil-related properties suffered a huge decline until I divested myself of all such stocks in 1985 at which point the industry while not lighting up any Christmas trees began a slow recovery
Likewise mutual funds remained relatively flat until I made what was for me a serious investment
By 1987 these properties were in a tailspin causing my broker at Pru-Bache to remark that she 'd never seen anything like it
Concerned for her state of mind I dropped them and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health
Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real-estate market which was booming until I entered it in late 1988 at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years
Disgusted I cast around for a different way to plan my asset distribution and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck me I was doing it already We 've all got money to spend some of it clearly disposable since we keep disposing of it
Bank it Not really Sock it away in long-term instruments Nonsense Daily living is the best possible investment Your priorities may be different but here in Figure 2 is where I 've chosen to build for the future personal space automotive pursuits children 's toys gardening equipment bulbs and shrubs and finally entertainment perhaps the best investment of all
All have paid off for me in double-digit annual growth and continue to provide significant potential
At least according to my calculations
Personal space Figure 3 has grown 35 % annually over the course of the decade a performance that would compare positively with an investment in say synthetic-leather products for the interiors of cold-weather vehicles which my cousin got into and sort of regrets to this day
The assortment of expensive children 's toys that I have purchased wisely at a host of discount-toy brokerage firms Figure 4 has increased handsomely in total asset value far beyond any personal investment except perhaps for my record collection whose worth I think it 's safe to say is incalculable
Continued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been part of my strategy Figure 5 with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60 % of the car 's original value
According to my calculations these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than 22,000 on the open market Figure 6 where I plan to offer it shortly
Expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns shrubs and bushes fitting to its suburban locale
I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers
My initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold according to my conservative calculations
At the same time my share in a wide variety of entertainment pursuits has given perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the benefits of creative personal financial planning
Over the course of the decade for instance my return on investment in the area of poker alone Figures 7A and 7B has been most impressive showing bodacious annual expansion with given the way my associates play no sign of abatement into the 1990s and beyond
With this personal strategy firmly in place I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage
My kids ' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending although I 'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it
But with every step I take I 'm building wealth
You can too if you like me refuse to bite the bullet
So go out there and eat that debt
You 're right there in the mainstream of American business building value on the back of insupportable expenditures
Henry Kravis watch out Mr. Schwartz is a business executive and writer in New York
WHEN JAMES SCHWARTZ was just a lad his father gave him a piece of career advice
He told me to choose an area where just by being mediocre I could be great recalls Mr. Schwartz now 40
He tried management consulting traded in turquoise for a while and even managed professional wrestlers
Now he has settled into a career that fits the bill financial planning
It should be noted that Mr. Schwartz who operates out of Englewood Colo. is a puckish sort who likes to give his colleagues the needle
But in this case the needle has a very sharp point
Though it 's probably safe to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent the fact remains that as one wag puts it anybody who can fog a mirror can call himself a financial planner
Planners now influence the investment of several hundred billion dollars but in effect they operate in the dark
There is no effective regulation of planners no accepted standard for admission into their ranks a dog got into one trade group no way to assess their performance no way even to know how many of them there are estimates range from 60,000 to 450,000
All anyone need do is hang up a shingle and start planning
So it should come as no shock that the profession if that 's what it is has attracted a lot of people whose principal talents seem to be frittering away or flat-out stealing their clients ' money
Alarmed state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate planners
Industry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards too they 're tired of seeing practitioners depicted collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzees and greedier than a herd of swine
But reform has n't taken hold yet
The industry is still pretty much in its Wild West days says Scott Stapf director of investor education for the North American Securities Administrators Association
An admittedly limited survey by NASAA whose members are state securities-law regulators found that between 1986 and 1988 fraud and abuse by financial planners cost 22,000 investors 400 million
The rogues ' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons a compulsive gambler or two various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy and one man who scammed his wife 's grandmother
What 's more the losses they and the others caused are just what we are stumbling over says Mr. Stapf adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go undetected
So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners
Nobody can estimate the toll but John Gargan a Tampa Fla. planner and head of one trade group the International Association of Registered Financial Planners thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is humongous far greater than that from crookery
His group like others wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners
Surveying all this some people now think the best planner might be no planner at all
For most investors the benefits just are n't worth the risks says Barbara Roper who follows financial-planning issues for the Consumer Federation of America a consumer-advocacy organization based in Washington
She concedes that such a position is unfair to the thousands of conscientious and qualified people plying the trade but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled to take it
She says her group used to give tips on selecting planners check educational and experience credentials consult regulators and Better Business Bureaus but found that even some people who took these steps were still getting ripped off
The bad news however has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business
But membership in the International Association of Financial Planners IAFP the industry 's biggest trade group is still nearly triple what it was in 1980 and it 's believed that the ranks of planners who do n't belong to any group have soared as well
An estimated 10 million Americans are now using financial planners and the pool of capital they influence is enormous
A survey of 54,000 of them conducted by the IAFP in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of 154 billion of their clients ' money in the previous 12 months
The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult if not impossible to regulate
Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as investment advisers people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically have been enough to swamp the agency 's capacity
The SEC has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers about the same as in 1980 even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade
Currently a registered investment adviser can expect an SEC audit only once every 12 years
A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years
It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem says Kathryn McGrath director of the SEC 's division of investment management
So the SEC has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded self-regulatory organization patterned on the National Association of Securities Dealers which operates in the brokerage business
Such an organization could among other things set minimum standards for competence ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules
The proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with
Mr. Schwartz the puckish planner from Englewood Colo. says that allowing the business to police itself would be like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank
Mr. Gargan the Tampa planner who heads one trade group favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the SEC to hire more staff
Mr. Gargan 's views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the IAFP the major industry organization
When the IAFP recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners Mr. Gargan 's group was excluded
That may be because Mr. Gargan smarting at what he considered slurs on his membership standards made by the rival group enrolled his dog Beauregard as a member of the IAFP
Then he sent the pooch 's picture with the certificate of membership it was made out to Boris Bo Regaard to every newspaper he could think of
The states have their own ideas about regulation and certification
NASAA the organization of state securities regulators is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states
It requires financial planners to register with states pass competency tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest
The most common conflict involves compensation
NASAA estimates that nearly 90 % of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities insurance and other financial products they recommend
The issue Is the planner putting his clients into the best investments or the ones that garner the biggest commissions In 1986 the New York attorney general 's office got an order from a state court in Albany shutting down First Meridian Corp. an Albany financial-planning firm that had invested 55 million on behalf of nearly 1,000 investors
In its notice of action the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into balanced investment portfolios instead the attorney general alleged the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high-risk investments in paintings coins and Florida condos
Those investments paid big commissions to First Meridian payments investors were never told about the attorney general alleged
Investors were further assured that only those with a minimun net worth would be accepted
In practice the attorney general alleged in an affidavit if an investor had access to cash the chances of being turned down by First Meridian were about as probable as being rejected by the Book-of-the-Month Club
And the attorney general added First Meridian 's president Roger V. Sala portrayed himself as a financial expert when his qualifications largely consisted of a high-school diploma work as a real-estate and insurance salesman and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth
First Meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general
Harry Manion Mr. Sala 's attorney says his client denies any wrongdoing and adds that the attorney general 's contentions about First Meridian 's business practices are incorrect
As for Mr. Sala 's qualifications the snooty attorneys for the state of New York decided Mr. Sala was n't qualified because he did n't have a Harvard degree says Mr. Manion
Civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common
Two such actions both filed earlier this year in Georgia state court in Atlanta could be particularly embarrassing to the industry both name J. Chandler Peterson an Atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the IAFP as defendant
One suit filed by more than three dozen investors charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the 9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest
Those companies in turn paid Mr. Peterson commissions and fees the suit alleges
The other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over 100,000 investments each says he made with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort to purchase the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale Ariz
One plaintiff a doctor testified in an affidavit that he also gave Mr. Peterson 50,000 to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician the privilege of making additional investments with Mr. Peterson
In affidavits each plaintiff claims Mr. Peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of 1988 or the money returned
Mr. Peterson took the plaintiffs ' and other investors ' money to a meeting of the bank 's directors
Wearing a business suit and western-style hat and boots he opened up his briefcase and dumped 1 million in cash on a table in front of the directors says Myron Diebel the bank 's president
He said he wanted to show the color of his money recalls Mr. Diebel
Bank officials however showed him the door and the sale never came off
According to the suit Mr. Peterson has yet to return the plaintiffs ' investment
They want it back
Mr. Peterson declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits saying he prefers to save such responses for court
But he does say that all of his activities have been entirely proper
On the suit by the limited partners he says he is considering a defamation suit against the plaintiffs
The suit he adds is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled people
Rearding the suit over the bank bid Mr. Peterson says it is filled with inflammatory language and half truths
He declines to go into specifics
Mr. Peterson says the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a sign of the times in which people generally are more prone to sue
I do n't know anybody in the industry who has n't experienced litigation he says
Mr. Peterson also says he does n't consider himself a financial planner anymore
He now calls himself an investment banker
In many scams or alleged scams involving planners it 's plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm 's way
Using it would n't a proessional hesitate to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest witha planner Other cases go to show that an old saw still applies If it sounds too good to be true it probably is
Certificates of deposit do n't pay 23 % a year for example but that did n't give pause to clients of one Alabama planner
Now they 're losers and he 's in jail in Mobile County
CDs yielding 40 % are even more implausible especially when the issuing bank in the Marshall Islands is merely a mail drop watched over by a local gas-station operator but investors fell for that one too
And the Colorado planner who promised to make some of his clients millionaires on investments of as litle as 100 Never mind
You already know the answer

They root among the designer offerings at Neiman-Marcus and Bullocks Wilshire
They stroll through the marble-encased corridors of the Atrium Court
They graze at the Farmers Market a combination gourmet food court and grocery store while a pianist accompanies the noon fashion show with a selection of dreamy melodies
The beautiful look of wool croons the show 's narrator slightly Victorian in its influence
Meanwhile in the squat office buildings that ring Fashion Island the odds are good that someone is getting fleeced
Law-enforcement authorities say that at any given time a host of fraudulent telemarketing operations mingle with the many legitimate businesses here
They seem to like these industrial parks says Kacy McClelland a postal inspector who specializes in mail fraud
We call them fraud farms
Welcome to that welter of contradictions known as Newport Beach
This city of more than 70,000 is known for sunshine yachts and rich residents
It is also known as the fraud capital of the U.S. dubbed by investigators and the media as the Cote de Fraud
How does a community famous for its high living end up as a haven for low-lifes Clearly the existence of the former lures the latter
The places renowned for breeding bunco like the Miami neighborhood known as the Maggot Mile and Las Vegas 's flashy strip of casinos invariably offer fast cars high rollers glamorous women and lots of sunshine
You do n't hear much about unusual concentrations of fraud in Green Bay or Buffalo
Con men hate snow
Newport Beach fits the scam artists ' specifications perfectly
What more could a con man in search of the easy life ask for Nothing seems hard here
The breezes are soft the waves lap gently and the palm trees sway lazily
Nightlife is plentiful
Moreover ostentation is appreciated
The median price of homes is 547,000 more than 9,000 vessels fill what the chamber of commerce calls the nation 's largest pleasure-boat harbor
Blondes cocaine and Corvettes mutters Mr. McClelland
That 's what they 're after
The rich image of Newport Beach also helps lend the con artists ' operation an air of respectability
One reason they use Newport Beach is that it sounds swankier than most addresses says David Katz a U.S. attorney who until recently headed a multi-agency Southern California fraud task force
Newport Beach is known in Rhode Island for having a lot of rich people
No wonder all kinds of big-time scams have flourished here from phony tax-sheltered Bible sales to crooked car dealers to bogus penny-stock traders
But above all this is the national headquarters for boiler-room operators those slick-talking snake-oil salesmen who use the telephone to extract money from the gullible and the greedy and then vanish
Because only a fraction of them are ever prosecuted nobody really knows how much money bogus telemarketing operators really harvest
I 've heard that there is 40 billion taken in nationwide by boiler rooms every year Mr. McClelland says
If that 's true Orange County has to be at least 10 % of that
And most of the truly big scams in Orange County seem to originate in Newport Beach or one of the other well-heeled communities that surround this sliver-like city that hooks around a point of land on the California coast south of Los Angeles
In fact sophisticated big-bucks boiler-room scams are known generically among law-enforcement types as Newport Beach operations
That contrasts with the penny-ante sales of things such as pen-and-pencil sets and office supplies that are known as Hollywood scams
Newport Beach telemarketers concentrate on precious metals and oil-leasing deals that typically cost thousands of dollars a shot
The investors range from elderly widows to affluent professionals
In one ingenious recent example of a Newport Beach boiler room prospective investors in Capital Trust Inc. were allegedly told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses caused by employees due to dishonesty destruction or disappearance according to an indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles last month
Thus falsely reassured investors sent 11.4 million to the Newport Beach company most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses the indictment charges
Douglas Jones an attorney representing Richard O. Kelly Sr. the chairman and president of Capital Trust says his client denies that there was any attempt to defraud investors
There were some business deals that went bad Mr. Jones says but no intent to defraud
Newport Beach operations differ from the Hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars
Traditionally boiler rooms operate on the cheap since few if any customers ever visit their offices
Indeed the name derives from the tendency among telemarketing scammers to rent cheap basement space near the boiler room
But says Mr. Katz the U.S. attorney the interesting thing about Newport Beach operations is that they give themselves the indulgence of beautiful offices with plush furnishings
When we go there it 's quite different from these Hollywood places where the sandwiches are spread out on the table and the people are picking their noses
The Newport Beach operators also tend to indulge themselves privately
Investigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine who is currently serving a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp. which promised investors returns of as much as 625 % on precious metals
Mr. Valentine who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in Los Angeles drove a leased Mercedes and lived in an expensive home on Lido Isle an island in Newport 's harbor according to investigators
With the 3 million received from investors he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits
It 's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose out to the dog track or to the tables in Las Vegas Mr. Katz says
All this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city 's legitimate business element
Vincent M Ciavarella regional manager of Property Management Systems insists he does n't know of any bogus telemarketers operating in the 1.6 million square feet of office space around Fashion Island that his company leases for Irvine Co. the owner and developer of the project
Mr. Ciavarella has rejected a few prospective tenants who provided incomplete financial information and acknowledges that illegitimate operators are not easily detectable
Investigators stress that building owners are victims too since boiler rooms often leave without paying rent
Richard Luehrs president of the Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce calls boiler rooms a negative we wish we could get rid of
Actually we do n't get much negative publicity about this he insists except for the press who write about it

YOU WENT to college and thought you got an education
Now you discover that you never learned the most important lesson How to send your kids to college
True when you went to college there was n't that much to learn
Stick some money in an interest-bearing account and watch it grow
Now investment salesmen say it 's time to take some risks if you want the kind of returns that will buy your toddler a ticket to Prestige U. in 18 years
In short throw away the passbook and go for the glory
The reason is cost
Nothing in the annals of tuition readied parents for the 1980s
Tuitions at private colleges rose 154 % in the 10 years ended in June of this year that 's twice the 77 % increase in consumer prices for the same period
A year at Harvard now goes for 19,395
By 2007 when this year 's newborns hit campus a four-year Ivy League sheepskin will cost 300,000 give or take a few pizzas-with-everything at exam time
Stanford MIT and other utmosts will cost no less
So what 's a parent to do Some investment advisers are suggesting in effect a bet on a start-up investment pool maybe even on margin
Others prefer deep-discount zero-coupon bonds
Still others say Why not take a chance on a high-octane growth fund You 're not going to make it in a 5 % bank account says James Riepe director of mutual funds at T. Rowe Price
To get the necessary growth adds Murray Ruffel a marketing official at the Financial Programs mutual-fund group you need to go to the stock market
In other words a little volatility never hurt
It never hurt anyone that is unless the growth funds do n't grow when you need them to
Or the zero-coupon bonds turn out not to have been discounted deeply enough to pay your kid 's tuition
That 's the dilemma for today 's parent
Although many experts are advising risk no one has a good answer for you if the risk does n't pay off
Help may be on the way
The antitrust division of the Justice Department is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and increases among the top schools
Fear of the price police could help cool things off in the 1990s
And then there 's always State U
But parents ' craving for a top-rated education for their children is growing like their taste for fancy wheels and vintage wine
Belatedly aware of public concern lawmakers and financial middlemen are working overtime to create and sell college savings and investment schemes
Their message explicit or implicit is that a good college will cost so much by whenever you want it that the tried and true wo n't do anymore
Forget about Treasury bills or a money-market fund
The latest wave of marketing is instructive
Several outfits including the Financial Programs Franklin and T. Rowe Price mutual-fund groups and the Edward D. Jones brokerage house are advertising college planner tables and charts that tell you how much you need to put aside regularly
The calculations generally rely on an after-tax rate of return of 8 % annually a rate historically obtainable by the individual in only one place the stock market
Most of the mailers are free but Denver-based Financial Programs sells for 15 a version customized to the age of the child and the college of choice
The figures are shocking
To build a nest egg that would pay for Stanford when a current first-grader reaches college age parents would need to set aside 773.94 a month for 12 years
They can cut this to 691.09 a month if the investing keeps up through college
And they can further reduce the monthly amount if they start saving earlier when mother and child come home from the hospital
Plugging a cheaper college into the formulas still does n't generate an installment most people can live with
Using a recent average private-school cost of about 12,500 a year T. Rowe Price 's planner prescribes 450 monthly if the plan begins when the child is six
Since the formula assumes an 8 % before-tax return in a mutual fund there would also be 16,500 in taxes to pay over the 12 years
Not everyone is so pessimistic
People are basically peddling a lot of fear says Arthur Hauptman a consultant to the American Council on Education in Washington
He takes issue with projections that do n't factor in students ' own contribution which reduces most parents ' burden substantially
Still he says it 's no bad thing if all the marketing prods people into putting aside a little more
The situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to do it out of current income he says
That 's crazy
His advice Do n't panic
Parents he says should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford
Half the amount that the investment tables suggest might be a good goal he adds
That way parents will reduce borrowings and outlays from current income when the time comes to pay tuition
Mr. Hauptman reckons that the best investment choice is mutual funds because they are managed and over time have nearly kept up with the broad stock averages
He favors either an all-stock fund or a balanced fund that mixes both stocks and bonds
In their anxiety however parents and other student benefactors are flocking to new schemes
They have laid out about 1 billion for so-called baccalaureate zero-coupon municipal bonds so far offered by Connecticut Illinois Virginia and eight other states
And they have bought about 500 million in prepaid-tuition plans offered in Michigan Florida and Wyoming
The prepaid plans take payment today usually at current tuitions or at a slight discount for a promise that tuition will be covered tomorrow
The baccalaureate bonds tax-free offered in small denominations and usually containing a provision that they wo n't be called before maturity seem to be tailor-made for college savers
Like other zeros they pay all their interest at maturity meaning that buyers can time things so that their bonds pay off just when Junior graduates from high school
Their compounding effect is also alluring
In June Virginia sold bonds for 268.98 that will pay 1,000 in 2009
But Richard Anderson head of the Forum for College Financing Alternatives at Columbia University a research group partly financed by the federal government says zeros are particularly ill-suited
Their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up
That wo n't matter if they are held to maturity but if for any reason the parents need to sell them before then there could be a severe loss of principal
Had zeros been available in 1972 and had parents bought a face amount equal to four years ' tuition at the time aiming for their children 's 1988 enrollment they would have been left with only enough to pay for two years Mr. Anderson figures
Most other bonds however would probably not have fared much better
The prepaid plans may be a good bet provided the guarantee of future tuition is secure
Issuing states generally limit the guarantees to in-state institutions however and buyers get refunds without much interest if the children do n't attend the specified schools
Two private groups are seeking Securities and Exchange Commission approval for plans that could be more broadly transferable
Mr. Anderson wants the prestige colleges to sponsor such a plan
The issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee
Prepayments much like mutual-fund purchases are pooled for investment
Sponsors are naturally counting on their ability to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns
But buyers are essentially betting on a start-up investment fund with no track record and some have been encouraged to borrow to do so
One problem is that the Internal Revenue Service has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the sponsors ' funds are taxable
The colleges as educational institutions had hoped that would n't be the case
Based on historical rates of return Mr. Anderson reckons a 100 % stock portfolio indexed to the market would have kept up with tuition and taxes in the 20th century
But sponsors might not pick the stocks that will match the market
And they 're leaning more toward fixed income whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases
I 'm not sure they 're going to make it work says Mr. Anderson
What happens if the sponsors do n't have the cash to pay the tuitions Florida and Wyoming have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack
Not so Michigan
Its plan is set up as an independent agency
The state says there 's no worry investment returns combined with fees and the gains from unused plans will provide all the cash it needs
Mr. Putka covers education from The Wall Street Journal 's Boston bureau
If you start saving for your child 's eduction on Jan. 1 1990 here 's the monthly sum you will need to invest to pay for four years at Yale Notre Dame and University of Minnesota
Figures assume a 7 % annual rise in tuition fees room and board and an 8 % annual investment return

AMONG THE CATFISH farmers in the watery delta land of Humphreys County Miss. Allen D. Tharp of Isola was one of the best known and most enterprising
He sold quarter-inch fingerlings to stock other farmers ' ponds and he bought back one-pound-or-so food-fish that he live-hauled to market along with his own whiskery crop
And he nearly always bought and sold for cash
Along the way Mr. Tharp omitted a total of 1.5 million from his receipts reported on federal tax returns for three years
The returns landed in the hands of an Internal Revenue Service criminal investigator Samuel James Baker
Mr. Baker interviewed or wrote to hundreds of catfish farmers live-haulers and processors throughout the South before coming up with detailed estimates of purchases and sales in pounds and dollars by Mr. Tharp and others
Unknown to Mr. Tharp he had fouled his net on a special IRS project to catch catfish farmers and haulers inclined to cheat on their taxes
Confronted with the evidence Mr. Tharp pleaded guilty to one charge of filing a false return and was fined 5,000 and sentenced to 18 months in prison
He also owes a lot of back taxes interest and civil fraud penalties
A lot of taxpayers out there are n't as paranoid as one might think
Federal and state tax enforcers develop many group targets for investigation on the basis of occupation high income type of income or some other characteristic that may signal an opportunity or tendency to hide income or exaggerate deductions
Many professions long have seemed to be targets because of the exotic or ludicrous efforts of some members to offset high income with fake losses from phony tax shelters dentists who invested in dubiously dubbed foreign films or airline pilots who raised racehorses on their days off
Mail-order ministers have been squelched
Now television and radio evangelists are under scrutiny
The IRS recently won part of its long-running battle with the Church of Scientology over exemptions when the U.S. Supreme Court held that members ' payments to the church were n't deductible because the members received services in return
IRS statistics show that the more persistent hiders of income among sole proprietors of businesses include used-car dealers entertainment producers masons roofers and taxi owners
Small businesses in general account for almost 40 % of unreported personal income the IRS has said
Once such abuses become so pervasive the IRS builds another factor into its secret computer formula for selecting returns for audit and does n't need special projects for them
San Franciscans have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula not because IRS agents envy their life styles
Many openings for mass cheating such as questionable tax shelters and home offices have gaped so broadly that Congress has passed stringent laws to close them
Deductions of charitable gifts of highly valued art now must be accompanied by appraisals
And laws requiring the reporting of more varieties of transactions have enabled the IRS to rely on computers to ferret out discrepancies with returns and to generate form-letter inquiries to taxpayers
Unreported alimony income can be spotted by computer because a payer of alimony who gets a deduction must report the former spouse 's Social Security number
Passport applicants now must give Social Security numbers enabling the IRS to see whether Americans living abroad are filing required U.S. returns
But while IRS computers focus routinely on target groups like these the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention
In most cases the IRS says these projects are local or regional rather than national and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among say factory workers claiming that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses
The national office currently has 21 noncriminal audit projects according to Marshall V. Washburn deputy assistant commissioner for examination
Auditors involved in noncriminal projects ca n't send anyone to jail but they can make life miserable in other ways for one by imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence failure to file a return and the like
The targeted audit groups include direct sellers people who sell cosmetics housewares and other items door to door or at home parties and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes
Other projects look for offenders among waiters who get cash tips people who engage in large cash transactions and people whose returns show they sold a home for a profit without reinvesting the capital gain in another home by the end of the same year the gain must be rolled over within two years to defer tax
And now that returns must show dependents ' Social Security numbers the IRS wants to see which dependents show up on more than one return and which dependents turn out to be deceased
Impetus for the direct-seller project came from a congressional hearing some years back
It prompted an IRS study that found many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs Mr. Washburn says
The study provided criteria for singling out returns of potentially noncompliant taxpayers who report low income and large expenses from a part-time business
The Tax Court recently denied business deductions by Mr. and Mrs. Peter S. Rubin of Cherry Hill N.J. who both were part-time distributors of Amway products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields
For 1984 they reported gross income of 1,647 from Amway sales offset by expenses totaling 16,746 including car costs of 6,805 and travel and entertainment costs of 5,088
The Tax Court did n't believe that the Rubins who earned 65,619 in their regular jobs treated the sideline as a real business and derived merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits from it
The Direct Selling Association a trade group points out that its members which include Amway Corp. cooperate with the IRS to distribute tax-compliance material to sales people and are helping to prepare a public-service television program on the subject
The independent-contractor project which began in 1988 involves about 350 IRS agents
In the fiscal nine months ended June 30 reports Raymond P. Keenan assistant commissioner for collection they examined about 13,000 employers assessed more than 67 million in delinquent employment taxes and reclassified about 56,000 workers as employees instead of self-employed contractors
The number of misclassified workers may be in the millions mostly paid by small firms
Many workers especially professionals want to remain independent to avoid tax withholding and to continue to deduct many expenses that employees ca n't
But many others who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation become tipsters for the IRS says Jerry Lackey who manages the IRS project 's force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando
Firms that are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that are n't he says
In his area Mr. Lackey continues the miscreant employers most commonly are in construction doing framing drywall masonry and similar work
But a medical clinic with about 20 employees wrongly listed all of them including physicians and receptionists as independent contractors
The IRS assessed the clinic 350,000 in back payroll taxes
It assessed nearly 500,000 against a cruise-ship company that carried about 100 deckhands cooks bartenders entertainers and other employees as self-employed independents
Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an 80 million computer system in 1985
The state 's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that license or register professionals and businesses from exchange agreements with the IRS 24 other states and two Canadian provinces and even from phonebook Yellow Pages
Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer they single out high-income groups looking primarily for people who have n't filed New York income-tax returns
The state has combed through records relating to architects stockbrokers lawyers in the New York City area construction workers from out of the state and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states especially Florida which has no personal income tax
Soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state doctors dentists and accountants says Frederick G. Hicks director of the tax-department division that develops the computer-matching programs
The department has collected over 6.5 million from brokers so far and recommended more than 30 of them for criminal prosecution
In the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding 500,000 who were filing nonresident returns it squeezed 7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a Florida resident
We think we can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through the nonresident project Mr. Hicks declares

In finding good news in Berkeley 's new freshman admissions plan The Privileged Class editorial Sept. 20 you 're reading the headline but not the story
The plan indeed raises from 40 % to 50 % the number of freshmen applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria
But that does n't mean half of the students attending Berkeley will be admitted this way
The plan is talking about applicants admitted not students who enroll
Since the yield from this top slice of applicants is relatively low boosting admits from 40 % to 50 % will boost registrants from about 31 % to 38 % of the class
In addition perhaps 5 % of registrants will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials narrowly missed gaining them admission in the first category
But against that combined increase of 12 % in students chosen by academic criteria the plan eliminates a large category in which admissions now are based on grades test scores and supplemental points for factors such as high-school curriculum English-language proficiency and an essay
This category now accounts for about 19 % of admits and 22 % of registrants
The plan thus will decrease by 22 % for a net loss of 10 % the number of students admitted primarily by academic criteria
Who will take over these places The plan creates a new category of students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds a concept not yet defined and gives them about 10 % of the class
One of the plan 's authors has defended the socioeconomic disadvantage category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative-action preferences based on race
Perhaps it does
But the new category does not replace or reduce Berkeley 's broad racial preferences
Nor will students from racial-minority groups who are admitted through the new category be counted against the affirmative-action target for their group
The plan thus places a large new affirmative-action program based on socioeconomic disadvantage on top of the existing program based on race
The role of academic criteria in choosing Berkeley 's freshmen can only decline as a result

This is a story about suckers
Most of us know a sucker
Many of us are suckers
But what we may not know is just what makes somebody a sucker
What makes people blurt out their credit-card numbers to a caller they 've never heard of Do they really believe that the number is just for verification and is simply a formality on the road to being a grand-prize winner What makes a person buy an oil well from some stranger knocking on the screen door Or an interest in a retirement community in Nevada that will knock your socks off once it is built Because in the end these people always wind up asking themselves the same question How could I be so stupid There are unfortunately plenty of answers to that question and scam artists know all of them
These people are very skilled at finding out what makes a person tick says Kent Neal chief of the economic-crime unit of the Broward County State Attorney 's Office in Fort Lauderdale Fla. a major haven for boiler rooms
Once they size them up then they know what buttons to push

He used to be a boiler-room salesman peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins

The most obvious pitch of course is the lure of big returns
We 're all a little greedy
Everyone is vulnerable says Charles Harper associate regional administrator for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Miami
These guys prey on human frailties
While the promises of big profits ought to set off warning bells they often do n't in part because get-rich-quick tales have become embedded in American folklore
The overnight success story is part of our culture and our society puts an emphasis on it with lotteries and Ed McMahon making millionaires out of people says Michael Cunningham an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky in Louisville
Other people are making it overnight and the rest who toil daily do n't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along
Adds Spencer Barasch branch chief for enforcement at the SEC in Fort Worth Texas Why do people play the lottery when the odds are great against them People are shooting for a dream
Clearly though scam artists have to be a bit more subtle than simply promising millions the psychology of suckers is n't simply the psychology of the greedy
There 's also for instance the need to be part of the in-crowd
So one popular ploy is to make a prospective investor feel like an insider joining an exclusive group that is about to make a killing
Between 1978 and 1987 for instance SH Oil in Winter Haven Fla. sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents while turning away numerous other eager investors
The owner of the company Stephen Smith who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said the location of his wells was confidential according to a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller 's office
Neither the Amoco agreement nor the wells existed the suit alleged
Such schemes says Tony Adamski chief of the financial-crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington D.C. appeal to investors ' desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity
At times salesmen may embellish the inside information with the notion that this is some slightly shady slightly illegal investment the person is being included in says Mr. Cunningham
In appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others
It also adds to the mystery of the venture
Mr. Blodgett the boiler-room veteran believes that for many investors the get-rich-quick scams carry a longed-for element of excitement
Once people got into it I was allowing them to live a dream he says
He phoned them with updates on the investment such as funny things that happened at the well that week he says
You gave them some excitement that they did n't have in their lives
Mr. Blodgett who was convicted in Florida state court of selling unregistered securities and in California state court of unlawful use of the telephone to defraud and deceive is now on probation
He says he has quit the business and is back in school majoring in psychology with aspirations to go into industrial psychology
For some investors it 's the appearances that leave them deceived
The trappings of success go a long way wearing the right clothes doing the right things says Paul Andreassen an associate professor of psychology at Harvard
Conservative appearances make people think it 's a conservative investment
People honestly lose money on risky investments that they did n't realize were a crapshoot he says
Paul Wenz a Phoenix Ariz. attorney says a promise of unrealistic returns would have made him leery
But Mr. Wenz who says he lost 43,000 in one precious-metals deal and 39,000 in another says a salesman used a business-venture approach with him sending investment literature a contract limiting the firm 's liability and an insurance policy
When he visited the company 's office he says it had all the trappings of legitimacy
Still others are stung by a desire to do both well and good says Douglas Watson commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department 's bunko-forgery division
Born-again Christians are the most visible targets of unscrupulous do-gooder investment pitches
But hardly the only ones The scams promise among other things to help save the environment feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children
Psychologists say isolated people who do n't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud
Scam artists seek out such people or try to make sure that their victims isolate themselves
For instance salesmen may counter a man 's objection that he wants to discuss an investment with his wife by asking Who wears the pants in your family Or an investor who wants his accountant 's advice may be told You seem like a guy who can make up his own mind
Often con artists will try to disarm their victims by emphasizing similarities between them
William Lynes a retired engineer from Lockheed Corp. says he and his wife Lily warmed to the investment pitches of a penny-stock peddler from Stuart-James Co. in Atlanta after the broker told them he too had once worked with Lockheed
The Lyneses of Powder Springs Ga. have filed suit in Georgia state court against Stuart James alleging fraud
They are awaiting an arbitration proceeding
They say the broker took them out for lunch frequently
He urged them to refer their friends who also lost money
Donald Trinen an attorney for the penny-brokerage firm denies the fraud allegations and says the Lyneses were fully apprised that they were pursuing a high-risk investment
It 's not uncommon for these guys to send pictures of themselves or their families to ingratiate themselves to their clients says Terree Bowers chief of the major-frauds section of the U.S. attorney 's office in Los Angeles
We 've seen cases where salesmen will affect the accent of the region of the country they are calling
Anything to make a sale
Experts say that whatever a person 's particular weak point timing is crucial
People may be particularly vulnerable to flim-flam pitches when they are in the midst of a major upheaval in their lives
Sometimes when people are making big changes retiring from their jobs moving to a new area they lose their bearings says Maury Elvekrog a licensed psychologist who is now an investment adviser and principal in Seger-Elvekrog Inc. a Birmingham Mich. investment-counseling firm
They may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right time
They are obviously also more susceptible when they need money retirees for instance trying to bolster their fixed income or parents fretting over how to pay for a child 's college expenses
These people are n't necessarily stupid or naive
Almost all of us in comparable circumstances might be victimized in some way says Jerald Jellison a psychology professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles
Nick Cortese thinks that 's what happened to him
Mr. Cortese a 33-year-old Delta Air Lines engineer invested some 2,000 in penny stocks through a broker who promised quick returns
We were saving up to buy a house and my wife was pregnant says Mr. Cortese
It was just before the Christmas holidays and I figured we could use some extra cash
The investment is worth about 130 today
Maybe it was just a vulnerable time says Mr. Cortese
Maybe the next day or even an hour later I would n't have done it

FOX HUNTING HAS been defined as the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible but at least it 's exercise
At least it has a little dash
Most of us have to spend our time on pursuits that afford neither drab duties rather than pleasures
Like trying to buy life insurance for instance an endeavor notably lacking in dash
Call it the uninformed trudging after the incomprehensible
But sooner or later most of us have to think about life insurance just as we often have to think about having root-canal work
And my time has come
I 'm 33 married no children and employed in writing stories like this one
In times past life-insurance salesmen targeted heads of household meaning men but ours is a two-income family and accustomed to it
So if anything happened to me I 'd want to leave behind enough so that my 33-year-old husband would be able to pay off the mortgage and some other debts though not I admit enough to put any potential second wife in the lap of luxury
Figuring that maybe 100,000 to 150,000 would do but having no idea of what kind of policy I wanted I looked at the myriad products of a dozen companies and plunged into a jungle of gibberish
Over the past decade or two while I was thinking about fox hunting the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products variations on products and variations on the variations
Besides term life and whole life the old standbys we now have universal life universal variable life flexible adjustable universal life policies with persistency bonuses policies festooned with exotic riders living benefit policies and on and on
What to do First generalize
Shorn of all their riders special provisions and other bells and whistles insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories so-called pure insurance which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death and permanent insurance which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive
If all you want is death-benefit coverage pure insurance a term policy gives you maximum bang for your buck within limits
It 's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age
But term means just that the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires
It may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal if you flunk which means you need insurance more than ever you may not be able to buy it
Even if you 're healthy and can renew your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older
So term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks
There are all sorts of variations on term insurance policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt term riders tacked on to permanent insurance and many others
One variation that appealed to me at first was the Money Smart Term Life policy offered by Amex Life Insurance Co. the American Express unit to the parent company 's credit-card holders
Upon examination however I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense
Amex said it would charge me 576 a year for 100,000 of coverage and would pay me back all the premiums I put in if I canceled the policy after 10 years
Sounds great or does it First if I canceled I 'd have no more insurance a not insignificant consideration
Second the 5,760 I 'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation Amex not I would get the benefit of the investment income on my money income that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit
Third and most important Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount I 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I 'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile
That would be all right with Amex which could then lock in its investment profit but it does n't add up to a smart money move for me
Which goes to show that the First Law applies in insurance as in anything else There is no free lunch there is only marketing
And the Second Law unique to insurance If I die early I win a hollow victory since I ca n't enjoy it and if I live long the insurer wins
Always
This is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance the kind that amasses cash value
The word death can not be escaped entirely by the industry but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms preferring to talk about savings and investment instead
The implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature
That is gilding the lily
The fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into
That 's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package
Again no free lunch
This is reflected in a built-in mortality cost in effect your share of the company 's estimated liability in paying off beneficiaries of people who had the effrontery to die while under its protection
And in most cases a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is in effect paying the salesman 's commission as well investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years largely because of this
So view permanent insurance for what it is a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment
The simplest most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy
You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing and your cash value and dividends grow over the years
One newer wrinkle so called single-premium life you pay for the whole policy at once has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy loans and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment
Congress closed this loophole last year or thought it did
However Monarch Capital Corp. of Springfield Mass. has developed a combination plan of annuity and insurance coverage that it says does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences
But the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax-free is very small
I 'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately so I look into the broad category called universal life
Hugely popular it is far more flexible than straight whole life
I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year and I can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy
In looking at these and other policies I learn to ask pointed questions about some of the assumptions built into policy illustrations the rows of numbers that show me the buildup of my cash values over the years
They commonly give two scenarios One is based on interest rates that the company guarantees usually 4 % to 4.5 % and the other on the rate it is currently getting on investment often 8.5 % or more
Projecting the latter over several decades I find my cash buildup is impressive but can any high interest rate prevail for that long Not likely I think
Also some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year
These are not certain either
Companies are n't comfortable playing these games but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good says Timothy Pfiefer an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast a unit of Towers Perrin Co. the big New York consulting firm
Another factor to consider Some of the companies currently earning very high yields are doing so through substantial investment in junk bonds and you know how nervous the market has been about those lately
There are seemingly endless twists to universal life and it pays to ask questions about all of them
At a back-yard barbecue for example a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be guaranteed
I call her agent David Dominici
Yes he says premiums on such variable-rate coverage can be structured to vanish after a certain period but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection
If interest rates plunge the insurer may be knocking on my door asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection
I do n't like the sound of that
Some insurers have also started offering persistency bonuses such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield if the policy is maintained for 10 years
But Glenn Daily a New York-based financial consultant warns that many of these bonuses are just fantasies because most are n't guaranteed by the companies
And the feature is so new he adds that no insurer has yet established a track record for actually making such payments
So-called living-benefits provisions also merit a close inspection
Offered by insurers that include Security-Connecticut Life Insurance Co. Jackson National Life Insurance Co. and National Travelers Life Insurance Co. these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I 'm still alive
Some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy 's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer heart attarcks renal failure and kidney transplants
But the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect are narrowly defined vary from policy to policy and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance
Also financial planners advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling exempting these advance payments from taxes
And considering the extra cost of such provisions some figure that people interested in say paying for extended nursing-home care would be better off just buying a separate policy that provides it
I 'm more favorably impressed by no-load life even though it turns out to be low-load life
Insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise do n't use commissioned salesmen there is still a load annual administrative fees and initial setup charges but I figure that the lack of commission and of surrender fees for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot
I compared one universal policy for 130,000 face amount from such an insurer American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln Neb. with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. which operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen
After one year I could walk away from the Ameritas policy with 792 but Id get only 14 from the Equitable
The difference is magnified by time too
At age 65 when I 'd stop paying premiums the Ameritas offering would have a projected cash value 14,000 higher than the other even though the Equitable 's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate
Did I buy it Well not yet
I 'm thinking about using the 871 annual premium to finance a trip to Paris first
A person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there and shop for something more exciting while she 's doing it
Rorer Group Inc. will report that third-quarter profit rose more than 15 % from a year earlier though the gain is wholly due to asset sales Robert Cawthorn chairman president and chief executive officer said
His projection indicates profit in the latest quarter of more than 17.4 million or 55 cents a share compared with 15.2 million or 48 cents a share a year ago
Mr. Cawthorn said in an interview that sales will show an increase from a year ago of somewhat less than 10 %
Through the first six months of 1989 sales had grown about 12 % from the year-earlier period
Growth of 10 % would make sales for the latest quarter 269 million compared with 244.6 million a year ago
Mr. Cawthorn said the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two Rorer drugs
Asilone an antacid was sold to Boots PLC London
Thrombinar a drug used to stanch bleeding was sold to Jones Medical Industries Inc. St. Louis
He said Rorer sold the drugs for nice prices and will record a combined pretax gain on the sales of 20 million
As the gain from the sales indicates operating profit was significantly below the year-earlier level Mr. Cawthorn said
Rorer in July had projected lower third-quarter operating profit but higher profit for all of 1989
He said the company is still looking for a strong fourth quarter in all areas sales operating income and net income
Mr. Cawthorn attributed the decline in third-quarter operating profit to the stronger dollar which reduces the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars to accelerated buying of Rorer products in the second quarter because of a then-pending July 1 price increase and to higher marketing expenses for Rorer 's Maalox antacid whose sales and market share in the U.S. had slipped in the first half of 1989
He said Rorer opted to sell Asilone and Thrombinar to raise revenue that would kick start its increased marketing efforts behind Maalox still its top-selling product with about 215 million in world-wide sales in 1988
We had underfunded Maalox for a year he said because the company was concentrating on research and development and promoting other drugs
He said Rorer will spend 15 million to 20 million more on Maalox advertising and promotion in the second half of 1989 than in the year-earlier period
A big chunk of that additional spending came in the third quarter he said
Hoechst AG said it will stop producing fertilizer in 1990 because of continued losses and a bleak outlook
The West German chemical concern said it will close the last remaining fertilizer plant in Oberhausen in the fall of next year
Hoechst said the fertilizer market faces overcapacity in Western Europe rising imports from East bloc countries and overseas and declining demand
HomeFed Corp. said its main subsidiary Home Federal Savings & Loan converted from a federal savings and loan to a federal savings bank and changed its name to HomeFed Bank

The consumer price index rose 0.2 % in September while many economists were looking for a 0.4 % increase
Stock-index arbitrage buy programs in which traders buy stock against offsetting positions in futures to lock in price differences helped the rally 's momentum
The euphoria was such that investors responded to good earnings reports of companies such as American Express while ignoring the disappointing profits of companies such as Caterpillar analysts said
Stock-index arbitrage trading was a minor influence in yesterday 's rally traders said
Institutional buyers were the main force pushing blue chips higher
To the amazement of some traders takeover stocks were climbing again

That 's put some oomph back into this market said Peter VandenBerg a vice president of equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton
But some traders thought there was less to the rally than met the eye
There is no strength behind this rally asserted Chung Lew head trader at Kleinwort Benson North America
It 's traders squaring positions
It 's not good the market is setting up for another fall

The Senate rejected a constitutional amendment that President Bush sought to protect the U.S. flag from desecration
The 51-48 roll call fell well short of the two-thirds majority needed to approve changes to the Constitution
The vote in which 11 GOP lawmakers voted against Mr. Bush 's position was a victory for Democratic leaders who opposed the amendment as an intrusion on the Bill of Rights
We can support the American flag without changing the American Constitution said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine
In order to defuse pressure for an amendment Mr. Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas Foley D. Wash
had arranged for lawmakers to pass a statute barring flag desecration before voting on the constitutional change
Mr. Bush said he would allow the bill to become law without his signature because he said only a constitutional amendment can protect the flag adequately
In June the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of a Texas man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration saying he was engaging in political expression that is protected by the First Amendment
If you think you have stress-related problems on the job there 's good news and bad news
You 're probably right and you are n't alone
A new Gallup Poll study commissioned by the New York Business Group on Health found that a full 25 % of the work force at companies may suffer from anxiety disorders or a stress-related illness with about 13 % suffering from depression
The study surveyed a national group of medical directors personnel managers and employee assistance program directors about their perceptions of these problems in their companies
It is one of a series of studies on health commissioned by the New York Business Group a non-profit organization with about 300 members
The stress study was undertaken because problems related to stress are much more prevalent than they seem said Leon J. Warshaw executive director of the business group
In presenting the study late last week Dr. Warshaw estimated the cost of these types of disorders to business is substantial
Occupational disability related to anxiety depression and stress costs about 8,000 a case in terms of worker 's compensation
In terms of days lost on the job the study estimated that each affected employee loses about 16 work days a year because of stress anxiety or depression
He added that the cost for stress-related compensation claims is about twice the average for all injury claims
We hope to sensitize employers to recognize the problems so they can do something about them Dr. Warshaw said
Early intervention into these types of problems can apparently save businesses long-term expense associated with hospitalization which sometimes results when these problems go untreated for too long
Even the courts are beginning to recognize the link between jobs and stress-related disorders in compensation cases according to a survey by the National Council on Compensation Insurance
But although 56 % of the respondents in the study indicated that mental-health problems were fairly pervasive in the workplace there is still a social stigma associated with people seeking help
The disorders which 20 years ago struck middle-age and older people now strike people at the height of productivity says Robert M.A. Hirschfeld of the National Institute of Mental Health who spoke at the presentation of the study 's findings
The poll showed that company size had a bearing on a manager 's view of the problem with 65 % of those in companies of more than 15,000 employees saying stress-related problems were fairly pervasive and 55 % of those in companies with fewer than 4,000 employees agreeing
The poll also noted fear of a takeover as a stress-producing event in larger companies
More than eight in 10 respondents reported such a stress-provoking situation in their company
Mid-sized companies were most affected by talk of layoffs or plant closings
The study which received funding from Upjohn Co. which makes several drugs to treat stress-related illnesses also found 47 % of the managers said stress anxiety and depression contribute to decreased production
Alcohol and substance abuse as a result of stress-related problems was cited by 30 % of those polled
Although Dr. Warshaw points out that stress and anxiety have their positive uses stress perceived to be threatening implies a component of fear and anxiety that may contribute to burnout
He also noted that various work environments such as night work have their own stressors
We all like stress but there 's a limit says Paul D'Arcy of Rohrer Hibler & Replogle a corporate psychology and management consulting firm
The problem says Mr. D'Arcy a psychologist is that it 's very hard to get any hard measures on how stress affects job performance
For Cheap Air Fares Spend Christmas Aloft IT IS N'T TRUE that a 90-year old clergyman on a mission of mercy to a disaster area on Christmas Day can fly free
But his circumstances are among the few that can qualify for the handful of really cheap airline tickets remaining in America
In recent years carriers have become much more picky about who can fly on the cheap
But there still are a few ways today 's traveler can qualify under the airline 's many restrictions
One of the best deals though may mean skipping Christmas dinner with the relatives
This week many carriers are announcing cut-rate fares designed to get people to fly on some of the most hallowed and slowest days of the year including Christmas
In recent years the airlines had waited until the last moment to court Christmas season vacationers with bargain fares
That approach flopped Last Christmas Day a USAir Group Inc. DC-9 jetliner flew about seven passengers from Chicago to Pittsburgh
So this year the airlines are getting a jump on holiday discounts
They are cutting ticket prices by as much as 70 % from normal levels for travel to most U.S. locations on Dec. 24 25 29 30 and 31 and Jan. 4 5 and 6
The promotions dubbed everything from 'T- is the Season to be Jolly to Kringle fares put round-trip fares at 98 148 and 198
They 're trying to keep planes flying on days they 'd normally park them says Roger Bard president of Mr. Mitchell Travel Service in Burnsville N.C
Expect of course sky-high prices on other dates near the holidays when the airlines know vacationers are eager to travel
Consider Adopting Your Spouse 's Name IF CONTINENTAL Airlines has its way couples like Marlo Thomas and Phil Donahue may find it a hassle to qualify for some new discounts
Continental a Texas Air Corp. unit recently unveiled a marketing program offering free companion tickets to business-class and first-class passengers on international flights
The Continental catch Only immediate family members are allowed and they must have the same last name as the buyer of the ticket or legal proof they 're related
That irritates many women who have n't taken their husbands ' last name
What a bunch of nonsense says Jessica Crosby president of the New York chapter of the National Association of Women Business Owners
This sets things way back
Continental 's logic It does n't want business companions abusing the promotion by falsely claiming to be related
We accommodate their choice of names by allowing them to demonstrate family affiliation with legal documents says Jim O'Donnell a senior vice president
But gay rights advocates are angry too
The Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund of New York City has received complaints from homosexual couples whom the airline does n't recognize as family
It 's certainly discrimination says attorney Evan Wolfson whose group forced Trans World Airlines this year to change a rule that allowed travelers to transfer frequent flier awards only to family members
Take Your Vacation In a Hurricane Area WHEN HURRICANE Hugo careened through the Caribbean and the Atlantic coast states it downed electric and telephone lines shot coconuts through cottage rooftops shattered windows and uprooted thousands of lives
It also lowered some air fares
Since the hurricane Midway Airlines Inc. and American Airlines a unit of AMR Corp. trimmed their one-way fares to the Virgin Islands to 109 from prices that were at times double that before the storm
The fares are code-named Hugo Compassion and Virgin Islands Aid
Airlines are n't lowering fares to Northern California following this week 's earthquake but reservation agents can waive advance-purchase restrictions on discount fares for emergency trips
Some hotels in the hurricane-stricken Caribbean promise money-back guarantees
In Myrtle Beach S.C. the damaged Yachtsman Resort offers daily rates as low as 35 or as much as 22 % below regular prices
Says Michele Hoffman a clerk in the resort 's front office We do n't have the outdoor pool the pool table ping pong table snack bar or VCR but we still have the indoor pool and Jacuzzi
Just Wait Until You 're a Bit Older SENIOR CITIZENS have long received cheap air fares
This year the older someone is the bigger the discount
A senior citizen between 62 and 70 saves 70 % off regular coach fare
Travelers up to age 99 get a percentage discount matching their age
And centenarians fly free in first class
Next month Northwest Airlines says a 108-year-old Lansing Mich. woman is taking it up on the offer to fly with her 72-year-old son to Tampa Fla
Last year when Northwest first offered the promotion only six centenarians flew free
If All Else Fails
THE NATION'S carriers also provide discounts to Red Cross workers retired military personnel and medical students
There 's even a special fare for clergy that does n't require the usual stay over Saturday night
That way they can be home in time for work Sunday
The British Petroleum Co. PLC said its BP Exploration unit has produced the first oil from its Don oilfield in the North Sea
In an official release BP said initial production from the field was 11,000 barrels a day and that it expects peak output from the field of 15,000 barrels a day to be reached in 1990
As the sponsor of the Older Americans Freedom to Work Act which would repeal the Social Security earnings limit for people aged 65 and older I applaud your strong endorsement to repeal this Depression-era fossil
For every dollar earned over 8,880 Social Security recipients lose 50 cents of their Social Security benefits it 's like a 50 % marginal tax
But the compounded effects of seniors only taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates
Imagine a widow who wants to maintain her standard of living at the same level she had before she had to pay the catastrophic surtax
Although this widow earns only twice the minimum wage largely due to the earnings limit she would have to earn an additional 4,930 to offset her catastrophic surtax of 496
Eliminating the earnings limit would greatly help seniors and reduce the deficit
Repeal would generate more in new taxes than the government would lose in increased Social Security benefit payments
We now need support from the Democrats on the Rules Committee in order to include earnings-limit reform in the Reconciliation Bill
Since all four Republicans on the committee are co-sponsors of my bill it is the Democrats who will be held fully accountable if an earnings test amendment is not allowed from the floor
The time is now to lift the burdensome Social Security earnings limit from the backs of our nation 's seniors
Rep. J. Dennis Hastert R. Ill
When his Seventh Avenue fur business here was flying high 20 years ago Jack Purnick had 25 workers and a large factory
Now his half-dozen employees work in an eighth-floor shop that he says is smaller than his old storage room
He also says he is losing money now
He blames imports
But just down Seventh Avenue where about 75 % of U.S. fur garments are made Larry Rosen has acquired two retail outlets broadened his fur-making line and expanded into leather
He credits imports
The difference lies in how the two entrepreneurial furriers reacted to the foreign competition and transformation of their industry over the past 10 years
One stuck to old-line business traditions while the other embraced the change
The small good fur salon is not what it used to be says Mr. Purnick 75 years old
We make the finest product in the world and the Americans are being kicked around
Mr. Rosen though believes imports have reinvigorated the industry in which he has worked for most of his 57 years
You 've got some minds here that wo n't think progressively he says
Import competition for U.S. furs has risen sharply since furriers started aggressively marketing working-girl mink and similar lower-priced imported furs in recent years
Merchants discovered a consumer largely ignored by higher-priced furriers the younger woman even in her late 20s who never thought she could buy a mink
The new market helped boost U.S. fur sales to about 1.8 billion a year now triple the level in the late 1970s
It also opened the door to furs made in South Korea China Hong Kong and other countries
Jindo Furs a large South Korean maker says it operates 35 retail outlets in the U.S. and plans to open 15 more by the end of next year
Mr. Purnick and other old-line furriers call many of the the imports unstylish and poorly made
High-end U.S. furriers say these imports have n't squeezed them
But low-priced and middle-priced furriers like Mr. Purnick who once saturated the five-block Seventh Avenue fur district say imports have cut their sales
A woman who once would have saved for two or three seasons to buy a U.S.-made mink can now get an imported mink right away for less than 2,000
Yet Mr. Rosen has turned the import phenomenon to his advantage
Early in the decade he saw that fur workers in many foreign countries were willing to work longer hours at lower wages than their American counterparts and were more open to innovation
In 1982 he started a factory in Greece
Two years later he opened one in West Germany
He also noticed that foreign makers were introducing many variations on the traditional fur and he decided to follow suit
By combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad he says he has been able to produce high-quality goods at low cost
To maintain control over production and avoid overdependence on foreign sources he says he still makes most of his furs in the U.S.
But six years ago he also began importing from the Far East
Inspired by imports Mr. Rosen now makes fur muffs hats and flings
This year he produced a men 's line and offers dyed furs in red cherry red violet royal blue and forest green
He has leather jackets from Turkey that are lined with eel skin and topped off with raccoon-skin collars
From Asia he has mink jackets with floral patterns made by using different colored furs
Next he will be testing pictured embroidery called kalega made in the Far East
He plans to attach the embroidery to the backs of mink coats and jackets
Besides adding to sales leathers also attract retailers who may buy furs later he adds
Other furriers have also benefited from leathers
Seymour Schreibman the 65-year-old owner of Schreibman Raphael Furs Inc. treats the reverse side of a Persian lambskin to produce a reversible fur-and-leather garment
He says it accounts for 25 % of total sales
Mr. Rosen is also pushing retail sales
This year he bought two stores one in Brooklyn and one in Queens
Other furriers have also placed more weight on retailing
Golden Feldman Furs Inc. began retailing aggressively eight years ago and now retail sales account for about 20 % of gross income
In other moves Mr. Rosen says he bought a truck three years ago to reach more retailers
Since then he has expanded his fleet and can now bring his furs to the front door of retailers as far away as the Midwest
Small retailers who ca n't afford to travel to his New York showroom have become fair game
Such moves have helped Mr. Rosen weather the industry slump of recent years
The industry enjoyed six prosperous years beginning in 1980 but since 1986 sales have languished at their 1.8 billion peak
Large furriers such as Antonovich Inc. Fur Vault Inc. and Evans Inc. all reported losses in their latest fiscal years
Aftereffects of the 1987 stock market crash head the list of reasons
In addition competition has glutted the market with both skins and coats driving prices down
The animal-rights movement has n't helped sales
Warm winters over the past two years have trimmed demand too furriers complain
And those who did n't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages
The intensive labor needed to manufacture furs in the U.S.
is not as available as it was says Mr. Schreibman who is starting overseas production
But even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump fear that furs are losing part of their allure
People are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business says Stephen Sanders divisional merchandise manager for Marshall Field 's department store in Chicago
You ca n't make a commodity out of a luxury insists Mr. Purnick the New York furrier
He contends that chasing consumers with low-priced imports will harm the industry in the long run by reducing the prestige of furs
But Mr. Rosen responds Whatever people want to buy I 'll sell
The name of the game is to move goods
Four workers at GTE Corp. 's headquarters have been diagnosed as having hepatitis and city health officials are investigating whether a cafeteria worker may have exposed hundreds of other GTE employees to the viral infection company and city officials said
The four cases were all reported to GTE 's medical director and state and local health authorities
GTE shut down its cafeteria Tuesday afternoon after testing determined that at least one cafeteria worker employed by GTE 's private food vending contractor ARA Services Inc. was suffering from a strain of the virus officials said
More than 700 people work in the GTE building
The cafeteria remains closed
Dr. Andrew McBride city health director said his staff suspects the hepatitis which can be highly contagious was spread by the cafeteria worker with the virus
The exact strain of hepatitis that the cafeteria worker contracted has n't been determined but should be known by the end of the week Dr. McBride said
Hepatitis A considered the least dangerous strain of the virus has been confirmed in at least one GTE employee company and city officials said
From a public health point of view we 're relieved because hepatitis A is rarely life-threatening said Dr. Frank Provato GTE 's medical director
It 's a double-edged sword though because it is also the most contagious kind of hepatitis
GTE officials began posting warning notices about the potential threat to exposure Wednesday morning at various places at the company said GTE spokesman Thomas Mattausch
The company has begun offering shots of gamma globulin which will diminish the flu-like symptoms of hepatitis A in anyone who has contracted the disease Mr. Mattausch said
We 're strongly recommending that anyone who has eaten in the cafeteria this month have the shot Mr. Mattausch added and that means virtually everyone who works here

In the wake of a slide in sterling a tailspin in the stock market and a string of problematic economic indicators British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy
In a speech prepared for delivery to London 's financial community Mr. Lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy using high interest rates as the essential instrument to carry out the campaign
Two weeks after boosting base rates to 15 % he pledged that rates will have to remain high for some time to come
Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully
A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation he argued
In an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the British currency he stated that the exchange rates will have a major role in the assessment of monetary conditions
In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound Mr. Lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy
He said he monitors the money-supply figures but does n't give them paramount importance as some private and government economists have suggested
Mr. Lawson also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on Britain 's financial system
Mr. Lawson 's speech delivered at the Lord Mayor of London 's annual dinner at Mansion House came on the heels of a grueling period for the U.K. economy
Two weeks ago in a campaign to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world-wide plunge in the pound he raised base rates a full percentage point to 15 %
Despite the increase the British currency slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last week
It was quoted at 2.9428 marks in late New York trading Wednesday
Leading up to the speech was a drumroll of economic statistics suggesting that the British war on inflation will be more bruising than previously assumed
Unemployment in September dropped to 1,695,000 the lowest level since 1980
While lower joblessness is generally good news the hefty drop last month indicates that the economy is n't slowing down as much as hoped despite a doubling of interest rates over the last 16 months
Meanwhile average earnings in Britain were up 8.75 % in August over the previous year
Another inflationary sign came in a surge in building-society lending to a record 10.2 billion 16.22 billion last month a much higher level than economists had predicted
In a separate speech prepared for delivery at the dinner Robin Leigh-Pemberton Bank of England governor conceded that demand pressures were even more buoyant than had been appreciated when the British economy was heating up last year
He added that there 's no quick-fix solution to the economic woes and said tight monetary policy is the right approach
Discussing the recent slide in stock prices the central bank governor stated that the markets now appear to have steadied after the nasty jolt of the 190.58-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average a week ago
Although the New York market plunge prompted a 70.5-point drop in the London Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index Mr. Leigh-Pemberton declared that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the British economy
Specifically he pointed out that compared with the U.S. market the U.K. has far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings
Discussing future monetary arrangements Mr. Lawson repeated the Thatcher government 's commitment to join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System but he did n't indicate when

C. Olivetti & Co. claiming it has won the race in Europe to introduce computers based on a powerful new microprocessor chip unveiled its CP486 computer yesterday
The product is the first from a European company based on Intel Corp. 's new 32-bit 486tm microprocessor which works several times faster than previously available chips
Hewlett-Packard Co. became the first company world-wide to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month but it wo n't start shipping the computers until early next year
An Olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories are already beginning to produce the machine and that it should be available in Europe by December
What this means is that Europeans will have these machines in their offices before Americans do the spokesman said
The new chip is a very big step in computing and it is important that Olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product said Patricia Meagher Davis an analyst at James Capel & Co. in London
Executives at Olivetti whose earnings have been steadily sliding over the past couple of years have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market
Ms. Davis said the new machines could steal some sales away from Olivetti 's own minicomputers but would bring new sales among professionals such as engineers stockbrokers and medical doctors
Although Olivetti 's profits tumbled 40 % in the first half of this year she believes Olivetti 's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by December
We think the worst is over in the European information-technology market she said
Depending on the type of software and peripherals used the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals a role usually filled by a minicomputer as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer
It 's the missing link in Olivetti 's product line between small personal computers and higher-priced minicomputers the Olivetti spokesman said
He added that Olivetti will continue making its LSX minicomputer line
The machines will cost around 16,250 on average in Europe
The Intel 486 chip can process 15 million instructions per second or MIPS while Intel 's previous 386 chip could handle only 3 to 6 MIPS
Olivetti also plans to sell the CP486 computer in the U.S. starting next year through Olivetti USA and through its ISC\/Bunker Ramo unit which specializes in automating bank-branch networks
Viatech Inc. said it received approval from the French government for its proposed 44.7 million acquisition of Ferembal S.A
The approval satisfies the remaining conditions of the purchase which is expected to close within two weeks
erembal the second-largest maker of food cans in France had 1988 sales of 150 million
Ferembal has 930 workers at four canning manufacturing plants and one plastic container facility
Viatech makes flexible packaging films and machinery and materials for the food and pharmaceutical industries
Social Security benefits will rise 4.7 % next year to keep pace with inflation boosting the average monthly benefit to 566 from 541 the Department of Health and Human Services announced
The higher payments will start with Social Security checks received on Jan. 3 1990
Supplemental Security Income payments to the disabled also will rise 4.7 % starting with checks received on Dec. 29 1988 increasing the maximum SSI payment to 386 from 368 a month
The inflation adjustment also means that the maximum annual level of earnings subject to the wage tax that generates revenue for the Social Security trust fund will rise to 50,400 in 1990 from 48,000 this year
As mandated by law the tax rate will rise to 7.65 % in 1990 from 7.51 % and wo n't rise any further in the future
This means that the maximum yearly Social Security tax paid by workers and employers each will rise 250.80 next year to 3,855.60
Beneficiaries aged 65 through 69 will be able to earn 9,360 without losing any Social Security benefits in 1990 up from 8,880 this year
The exempt amount for beneficiaries under 65 will rise to 6,840 from 6,480
The adjustments reflect the increase in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year
Health-care companies should get healthier in the third quarter
Medical-supply houses are expected to report earnings increases of about 15 % on average for the third quarter despite sales increases of less than 10 % analysts say
To offset sluggish sales growth companies have been cutting staff mostly through attrition and slowing the growth in research and development spending
Sales growth in the quarter was slowed by mounting pressure from groups of buyers such as hospitals to hold down prices
Suppliers were also hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar which makes sales abroad more difficult
In some cases competition has squeezed margins
Becton Dickinson & Co. for example faces stiff competition from a Japanese supplier in the important syringe market
The Franklin Lakes N.J. company is expected to report sales growth of only 5 % to 6 % but should still maintain earnings growth of 10 % says Jerry E. Fuller an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc
Among the first of the group to post results Abbott Laboratories said third-quarter net income jumped 14 % to 196 million or 88 cents a share from 172 million or 76 cents a share a year earlier
Sales for the company based in Abbott Park Ill. rose 8.3 % to 1.31 billion from 1.21 billion
Baxter International Inc. yesterday reported net climbed 20 % in the third period to 102 million or 34 cents a share from 85 million or 28 cents a share a year earlier
Sales for the Deerfield Ill. company rose 5.8 % to 1.81 billion from 1.71 billion
But not every company expects to report increased earnings
C.R. Bard Inc. yesterday said third-quarter net plunged 51 % to 9.9 million or 18 cents a share from 20 million or 35 cents a share a year earlier
Sales fell 1.2 % to 190.1 million from 192.5 million
The Murray Hill N.J. company said full-year earnings may be off 33 cents a share because the company removed a catheter from the market
In 1988 the company earned 1.38 a share
The Food and Drug Administration had raised questions about the device 's design
Some analysts add that third-party pressures to reduce health costs will continue to bedevil companies ' bottom lines
Takeover speculation which has been buoying stocks of supply houses may also ease says Peter Sidoti an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc
As that wanes you 're going to see the stocks probably wane as well he says
Hospitals companies meanwhile are reporting improved earnings
Bolstered by strong performances by its psychiatric hospitals National Medical Enterprises Inc. Los Angeles reported net income of 50 million or 65 cents a share for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 up from 41 million or 56 cents a share a year earlier
Humana Inc. Louisville Ky. also reported favorable results with net income of 66.7 million or 66 cents in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31 up from 58.2 million or 59 cents a year earlier
Analysts say the handful of hospital companies that are still publicly traded are benefiting from several trends
Most important hospital admission rates are stabilizing after several years of decline
Moreover companies have sold off many of their smaller less-profitable hospitals and have completed painful restructurings
Humana 's revenues for example are being boosted by large increases in enrollments in the company 's health maintenance organizations
Says Todd Richter an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds The shakeout in the publicly traded companies is over
Initial claims for regular state unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 396,000 during the week ended Oct. 7 from 334,000 the previous week the Labor Department said
The number of people receiving regular state benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 decreased to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000 or 2.2 % of those covered by unemployment insurance from 2,205,000 the previous week when the insured unemployment rate also was 2.2 %
Counting all state and federal benefit programs the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 fell to 1,809,300 from 1,838,200 a week earlier
These figures are n't seasonally adjusted
A Labor Department spokesman said the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states particularly North Carolina and South Carolina
The figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking Nynex Corp. workers who have become eligible for unemployment benefits the official said
Digital Equipment Corp. reported a 32 % decline in net income on a modest revenue gain in its fiscal first quarter causing some analysts to predict weaker results ahead than they had expected
Although the second-largest computer maker had prepared Wall Street for a poor quarter analysts said they were troubled by signs of flat U.S. orders and a slowdown in the rate of gain in foreign orders
The Maynard Mass. company is in a transition in which it is trying to reduce its reliance on mid-range machines and establish a presence in workstations and mainframes
Net for the quarter ended Sept. 30 fell to 150.8 million or 1.20 a share from 223 million or 1.71 a share a year ago
Revenue rose 6.4 % to 3.13 billion from 2.94 billion
Digital said a shift in its product mix toward low-end products and strong growth in workstation sales yielded lower gross margins
A spokesman also said margins for the company 's service business narrowed somewhat because of heavy investments made in that sector
The lack of a strong product at the high end of Digital 's line was a significant drag on sales
Digital hopes to address that with the debut of its first mainframe-class computers next Tuesday
The new line is aimed directly at International Business Machines Corp
Until the new mainframe products kick in there wo n't be a lot of revenue contribution at the high end and that 's hurt us said Mark Steinkrauss Digital 's director of investor relations
He said unfavorable currency translations were also a factor in the quarter
DEC shares rose 1.375 to 89.75 apiece in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday
But analysts said that against the backdrop of a nearly 40-point rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that should n't necessarily be taken as a sign of great strength
Some cut their earnings estimates for the stock this year and predicted more efforts to control costs ahead
I think the next few quarters will be difficult said Steven Milunovich of First Boston
Margins will remain under pressure and when the new mainframe does ship I 'm not sure it will be a big winner
Mr. Milunovich said he was revising his estimate for DEC 's current year from 8.20 a share to well below 8 although he has n't settled on a final number
One troubling aspect of DEC 's results analysts said was its performance in Europe
DEC said its overseas business which now accounts for more than half of sales improved in the quarter
It even took the unusually frank step of telling analysts in a morning conference call that orders in Europe were up in double digits in foreign-currency terms
That gain probably translated into about 5 % to 7 % in dollar terms well below recent quarters ' gains of above 20 % reckons Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds
That was a disappointment and a sign of overall computer-market softness in Europe Mr. Stevens said
Marc Schulman with UBS Securities in New York dropped his estimate of DEC 's full-year net to 6.80 a share from 8
Although overall revenues were stronger Mr. Schulman said DEC drew down its European backlog and had flat world-wide orders overall
The bottom line is that it 's more hand to mouth than it has been before he said
Mr. Schulman said he believes that the roll-out of DEC 's new mainframe will occur somewhat more leisurely than many of his investment colleagues expect
He said current expectations are for an entry level machine to be shipped in December with all of the more sophisticated versions out by June
For reasons he would n't elaborate on he said he 's sure that schedule wo n't be met meaning less profit impact from the product for DEC in the next few quarters

Colgate Palmolive Co. reported third-quarter net income rose 27 % bolstered by strong sales in its Latin American business and surprisingly healthy profits from U.S. operations
Colgate said net income for the quarter rose to 76.7 million or 1.06 a share on sales that increased 6 % to 1.3 billion
In the year-earlier period Colgate posted net income of 60.2 million or 88 cents a share
Last year 's results included earnings from discontinued operations of 13.1 million or 19 cents a share
Reuben Mark chairman and chief executive officer of Colgate said earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in Latin America the Far East and Europe
Results were also bolstered by a very meaningful increase in operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. business he said
Operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. household products and personal care businesses which include such well-known brands as Colgate toothpaste and Fab laundry detergent jumped more than 40 % the company said
Mr. Mark attributed the improvement to cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations blending together two sales organizations and more carefully focusing the company 's promotional activities
We 've done a lot to improve U.S.
results and a lot more will be done Mr. Mark said
Improving profitability of U.S. operations is an extremely high priority in the company
Colgate 's results were at the high end of the range of analysts ' forecasts
The scope of the improvement in the U.S. business caught some analysts by surprise
The company 's domestic business especially its household products division has performed poorly for years
Analysts say the earnings improvement came from cutting costs rather than increasing sales
For the nine months net increased 14 % to 217.5 million or 3.09 a share
Sales rose 7 % to 3.8 billion
The company earned 191.1 million or 2.79 a share in the year-earlier period
Colgate 's 1988 net income included 40.1 million or 59 cents a share from discontinued operations
Colgate sold its hospital supply and home health care business last year
Separately Colgate Wednesday finalized an agreement with MacroChem Corp. a tiny dental products and pharmaceutical concern based in Billerica Mass. to market in the U.S. four of MacroChem 's FDA-approved dental products
The products sealants and bonding materials used by dentists all contain fluoride that is released over time
The move is part of a drive to increase Colgate 's business with dentists a company spokeswoman said
Terms of the agreement were n't given
USACafes Limited Partnership said it completed the sale of its Bonanza restaurant franchise system to a subsidiary of Metromedia Co. for 71 million in cash
USACafes which is nearly half-owned by Sam and Charles Wyly of Dallas said it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a liquidating dividend as soon as possible
The Bonanza franchise system which generates about 600 million in sales annually represented substantially all of the partnership 's assets
The sale of the system has been challenged in a class-action suit on behalf of unit holders filed last week in a Delaware court USACafes said
The company said it believes the suit is without merit
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled a sweetened pension and early-retirement program for management that it hopes will enable it to save 450 million in the next year
AT&T also said net income rose 19 % in the third quarter
AT&T said its amended pension program will nearly double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments
AT&T said that based on studies of other companies that have offered retirement plans it expects about one-third of its eligible managers to retire under the new program
AT&T said third-quarter net income grew despite stiff competition in all of the company 's markets
Net income rose to 699 million or 65 cents a share from the year-earlier 587 million or 55 cents a share
Revenue edged up to 8.9 billion from 8.81 billion
The latest period 's net was reduced 102 million or nine cents a share for a change in depreciation method and concurrent changes in estimates of depreciable lives and net salvage for certain telecommunications equipment
The results roughly matched estimates of securities analysts who were encouraged by AT&T increasing its operating margin to 13 % from 11 % a year ago because of continued cost-cutting efforts
Sales of long-distance services an extremely competitive market rose 6.4 %
But the growth was partly offset by lower equipment sales and rentals and price cuts on some products
Under the amended pension program AT&T managers who have at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes
Managers who retire Dec. 30 will have an additional 15 % added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age 65 whichever comes earlier
An AT&T spokeswoman said the company would likely replace about one-third of its managers who choose to retire with new employees
Analysts hailed the sweetened pension package which they said had been the subject of rumors for several months
This tells you AT&T is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to 20%-a-year earnings growth said Jack Grubman an analyst with PaineWebber Inc
But other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move wo n't result in even greater earnings growth
This is a good move but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are in terms of earnings growth said Joel D. Gross an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette
Mr. Gross said he had hoped that a cost savings of 450 million would result in even greater growth than the 20 % annual earnings increase AT&T has told analysts it expects in the future
AT&T said the special retirement option will increase fourth-quarter expenses
But the company said the amount ca n't be determined until it knows how many managers opt to retire
AT&T said the expense increase will be largely offset by a gain from its previously announced plan to swap its holdings in Ing
C. Olivetti & Co. for shares in Cie
Industriali Riunite an Italian holding company
For the nine months AT&T said net income was 1.99 billion or 1.85 a share up 19 % from 1.67 billion or 1.56 a share
Revenue gained 3.1 % to 26.81 billion from 26 billion
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange AT&T shares closed at 43.375 up 87.5 cents
When it comes to buying and selling shares Westridge Capital Management Inc. takes a back seat to no one
Every dollar 's worth of stock in the Los Angeles money manager 's portfolio is traded seven or eight times a year the firm estimates
That makes it the most active trader among all the nation 's investment advisers according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings
But wait a second
Westridge Capital is an index fund the type of stolid long-term investor whose goal is to be nothing more than average
Westridge Capital 's frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing
Indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer such as Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index and match its performance
Institutional investors have poured 210 billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns
These big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few active stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers much less beat it
And the fees investors pay for indexing run a few pennies for each 100 of assets a fraction of the cost of active managers
That 's because computers do most of the work and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs
But today indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one
Because index-fund managers are no longer satisfied with merely being average they have developed enhanced indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market as much as three percentage points
Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade but the index money has been just sort of sitting there says Seth M. Lynn president of Axe Core Investors Inc. an indexer based in Tarrytown N.Y
Now the interest is in what else can I do with that money
Among the souped-up indexing strategies Indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks or just a few dozen rather than being restricted to the S&P 500 companies
They can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks such as smaller companies those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry state or country
With today 's computer-driven program trading techniques index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500
Futures and options also make it possible to build synthetic index funds that do n't actually own a single share of stock but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market
One reason for these hybrids is that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing particularly for those plain vanilla funds that mirror the S&P 500
There is n't a boatload of big investors out there still waiting to get into indexing says P. James Kartalia vice president of ANB Investment Management Co. Chicago which offers both indexing and active management services
After tripling in size in the past five years index funds now hold about 20 % of the stock owned by pension funds
A further problem is razor-thin profits
Plain-vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing and in some cases are just that
To land customers for their well-paying stock custodial business big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free
It 's like getting a free toaster when you open an account says Axe Core 's Mr. Lynn
As a result indexers have been looking for ways to give investors something more than the average for their money
And many have been successful as in the case of the index fund operated by hyper-trader Westridge Capital
Westridge Capital has used enhanced indexing techniques to beat the S&P 500 's returns by 2.5 to 3 percentage points over the past four years with the same risk level as holding the S&P 500 stocks according to James Carder the firm 's president
Strategies vary for Westridge Capital which has 300 million under management
The firm sometimes buys S&P 500 futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies
Mr. Carder also goes through periods when he buys stocks in conjunction with options to boost returns and protect against declines
And in some months he buys stock-index futures and not stocks at all
By their nature our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover Mr. Carder adds
The more turnover the better for our clients
Big indexer Bankers Trust Co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns
J. Thomas Allen president of Pittsburgh-based Advanced Investment Management Inc. agrees it 's a good idea to jump between the S&P 500 stocks and futures
You 're buying the S&P and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it he says
But some indexers make little or no use of futures saying that these instruments present added risks for investors
If the futures markets have a problem then those products could have a problem says John Zumbrunn managing director of Prudential Insurance Co. of America 's Investment Index Technologies Inc. unit
Prudential currently is seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the S&P 500 index plus 5\/100 of a percentage point
An added feature is that the slighty improved return would be guaranteed by Prudential
There are many other strategies to bolster the returns of index funds
They include LIMITED RISK FUNDS These guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains
Here a fund may promise to pay back say 95 of every 100 invested for a year even if the market goes much lower
The fund could invest 87 for one year in Treasury bills yielding 8 % to return the guaranteed 95
That leaves 13 which could be used to buy S&P 500 options that will nearly match any gain in the S&P index
MANAGER REPLICATION FUNDS Say a big investor is interested in growth stocks
Instead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks indexers can design a portfolio around the same stocks the portfolio will be maintained by computer reducing both fees and in theory risk because of the large number of stocks
We see a lot of interest in those kind of things says Frank Salerno a vice president of Bankers Trust
People comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies
TILT FUNDS This is an index fund with a bet
Instead of replicating the S&P 500 or some other index exactly some stocks are overweighted or underweighted in the portfolio
One simple approach is to exclude S&P 500 companies considered bankruptcy candidates this can avoid weak sisters but also can hurt when a company like Chrysler Corp. rebounds
Another approach An investor with 100 million might use 75 million to buy the S&P 500 index and spend the other 25 million on a favorite group of stocks
SPECIALIZED FUNDS Indexes can be constructed to serve social goals such as eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in South Africa
Other funds have been designed to concentrate on stocks in a geographic area in order to encourage local investment
Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System for example has about 130 million invested in a fund of 244 companies that are either Pennsylvania-based or have 25 % of their work forces in the state
Short interest on the New York Stock Exchange declined for the second consecutive month this time 4.2 % while the American Stock Exchange reported its third consecutive record month of short interest
The Big Board reported that short interest dropped to 523,920,214 shares as of Oct. 13 from 547,347,585 shares in mid-September
Amex short interest climbed 3 % to 53,496,665 shares from 51,911,566 shares
For the year-earlier month the Big Board reported 461,539,056 shares indicating a 13.5 % year-to-year rise while the Amex reported 36,015,194 shares a 48 % leap
Amex short interest has been heading upward since mid-December with increases in each month since then except at mid-July
Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it betting that the stock 's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender
Short interest is the number of shares that have n't yet been purchased for return to lenders
Although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock 's price will decline some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back
Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging
The figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock
The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board short interest ratio slipped to 3.36 from last month 's 3.38
The ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange 's average trading volume that would be required to convert the total short interest position
Some analysts suggest however that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions
Varity Corp. led the Big Board list of largest short volumes with 12,822,563 shares

Your Oct. 12 editorial Pitiful Helpless Presidency correctly states that I was critical of the Bush administration 's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust Manuel Noriega presented by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3
You are absolutely wrong however in opining that this position is some kind of flip-flop something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls
My position is one founded on both the facts and the law
Although you may have forgotten public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative
The public made up its mind about Gen. Noriega largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 8 9 10 and 11 1988 and again on April 4 1988
It was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of Gen. Noriega 's criminality and of his enduring relationships with a variety of U.S. government agencies
Those hearings also highlighted how Gen. Noriega was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay U.S. action against him and to exploit the administration 's obsession with overthrowing the Sandinistas to protect his own drug-dealing
As former Ambassador to Costa Rica Francis J. McNeil testified before the subcommittee the Reagan administration knew that Gen. Noriega was involved with narcotics but made a decision in the summer of 1986 to put Gen. Noriega on the shelf until Nicaragua was settled
As the report issued by the subcommittee concluded Our government did nothing regarding Gen. Noriega 's drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the Contra war
This decision resulted in at least some drugs entering the United States as a hidden cost of the war
Unfortunately this problem continued even after Gen. Noriega 's indictment
Throughout 1988 and this year I and others in Congress have pressed the U.S. to develop a plan for pushing this narcokleptocrat out of Panama
Regrettably two administrations in a row have been unwilling and unable to develop any plan military or economic for supporting the Panamanian people in their attempts to restore democracy
Sen. John Kerry D. Mass
For Vietnamese these are tricky often treacherous times
After years of hesitation economic and political reform was embraced at the end of 1986 but ringing declarations have yet to be translated into much action
Vietnam is finding that turning a stagnant socialist order into a dynamic free market does n't come easy
Here is how three Vietnamese are coping with change The Tire King Nguyen Van Chan is living proof that old ways die hard
Mr. Chan used to be an oddity in Hanoi a private entrepreneur
His business success made him an official target in pre-reform days
Mr. Chan now 64 years old invented a fountain pen he and his family produced from plastic waste
Later he marketed glue
Both products were immensely popular
For his troubles Mr. Chan was jailed three times between 1960 and 1974
Though his operation was registered and used only scrap he was accused of conducting illegal business and possessing illegal materials
Once he was held for three months without being charged
Things were supposed to change when Vietnam 's economic reforms gathered pace and for awhile they did
After years of experimenting Mr. Chan produced a heavy-duty bicycle tire that outlasted its state-produced rival
By 1982 he was selling thousands of tires
Newspapers published articles about him and he was hailed as the tire king
His efforts earned a gold medal at a national exhibition and attracted renewed attention from local authorities
District police in 1983 descended on his suburban home which he and his large family used as both residence and factory and demanded proof the house and equipment were his
He produced it
That was the first time they lost and I won he says
He was further questioned to determine if he was a real working man or an exploiter
Says Mr. Chan When I showed it was from my own brain they lost for the second time
But a few days later the police accused him of stealing electricity acquiring rubber without permission and buying stolen property
Warned he was to be jailed again he fled to the countryside
His family was given three hours to leave before the house and contents were confiscated
With only the clothes they were wearing family members moved to a home owned by one of Mr. Chan 's sons
After six months on the run Mr. Chan learned the order for his arrest had been canceled
He rejoined his family in January 1984 and began the long struggle for justice pressing everyone from Hanoi municipal officials to National Assembly deputies for restoration of his rights
He and his family kept afloat by repairing bicycles selling fruit and doing odd jobs
Mr. Chan achieved a breakthrough in 1987 and became a minor celebrity again when his story was published in a weekly newspaper
In 1988 18 months after the sixth congress formally endorsed family-run private enterprise district authorities allowed Mr. Chan to resume work
By late last year he was invited back as the tire king to display his products at a national exhibition
National leaders stopped by his stand to commend his achievements
Mr. Chan now produces 1,000 bicycle and motorbike tires a month and 1,000 tins of tire-patching glue in the son 's small house
Eighteen people pack the house 's two rooms the Chans four of their 10 children with spouses and eight of 22 grandchildren
Most sleep on the floor
Come daybreak eight family members and two other workers unroll a sheet of raw rubber that covers the floor of the house and spills out onto the street
The primitive operations also burst out the back door into a small courtyard where an ancient press squeezes rubber solution into a flat strip and newly made tires are cooled in a bathtub filled with water
Mr. Chan talks optimistically of expanding maybe even moving into the import-export field
First however he has unfinished business
When district authorities allowed him to resume manufacturing they released only one of his machines
They did n't return the rubber stocks that represent his capital
Nor did they return his house and contents which he values at about 44,000
He wants to recover more than just his property though
I want my dignity back he says
The Editor Nguyen Ngoc seemed an obvious choice when the Vietnamese Writers Association was looking for a new editor to reform its weekly newspaper Van Nghe
After the sixth congress journalists seized the opportunity provided by the liberalization to probe previously taboo subjects
Mr. Ngoc 57 years old had solid reformist credentials He had lost his official position in the association in he early 1980s because he questioned the intrusion of politics into literature
Appointed editor in chief in July 1987 Mr. Ngoc rapidly turned the staid Van Nghe into Vietnam 's hottest paper
Circulation soared as the weekly went way beyond standard literary themes to cover Vietnamese society and its ills
Readers were electrified by the paper 's audacity and appalled by the dark side of life it uncovered
One article recounted a decade-long struggle by a wounded soldier to prove officially he was alive
Another described how tax-collection officials in Thanh Hoa province one night stormed through homes and confiscated rice from starving villagers
The newspaper also ran a series of controversial short stories by Nguyen Huy Thiep a former history teacher who stirred debate over his interpretation of Vietnamese culture and took a thinly veiled swipe at writers who had blocked his entry into their official association
Van Nghe quickly made influential enemies
Those who manage ideology and a large number of writers reacted badly to the restyled paper says Lai Nguyen An a literary critic
After months of internal rumblings Mr. Ngoc was fired last December
His dismissal triggered a furor among intellectuals that continues today
Under Mr. Ngoc Van Nghe protected the people instead of the government says Nguyen Duy a poet who is the paper 's bureau chief for southern Vietnam
The paper reflected the truth
For the leadership that was too painful to bear
The Billionaire Nguyen Thi Thi is Vietnam 's entrepreneur of the 1980s
Her challenge is to keep her fledgling empire on top in the 1990s
Mrs. Thi did n't wait for the reforms to get her start
She charged ahead of the government and the law to establish Hochiminh City Food Co. as the biggest rice dealer in the country
Her success which included alleviating an urban food shortage in the early 1980s helped persuade Hanoi to take the reform path
Her story is becoming part of local folklore
A lifelong revolutionary with little education who fought both the French and the U.S.-backed Saigon regime she switched effortlessly to commerce after the war
Her instincts were capitalistic despite her background
As she rode over regulations only her friendship with party leaders including Nguyen Van Linh then Ho Chi Minh City party secretary kept her out of jail
Following Mr. Linh 's appointment as secretary-general of the party at the sixth congress Mrs. Thi has become the darling of doi moi the Vietnamese version of perestroika
The authorities have steered foreign reporters to her office to see an example of the new way of thinking
Foreign publications have responded with articles declaring her Vietnam 's richest woman
Some people call me the communist billionaire she has told visitors
Actually 67-year-old Mrs. Thi is about as poor as almost everyone else in this impoverished land
She has indeed turned Hochiminh City Food into a budding conglomerate but the company itself remains state-owned
She manages it with the title of general-director
The heart of the business is the purchase of rice and other commodities such as corn and coffee from farmers in the south paying with fertilizer farm tools and other items
Last year Hochiminh City Food says it bought two million metric tons of unhusked rice more than 10 % of the country 's output
The company operates a fleet of trucks and boats to transport the commodities to its warehouses
A subsidiary company processes commodities into foods such as instant noodles that are sold with the rice through a vast retail network
In recent years Mrs. Thi has started to diversify the company taking a 20 % stake in newly established partly private Industrial and Commercial Bank and setting up Saigon Petro which owns and operates Vietnam 's first oil refinery
Mrs. Thi says Hochiminh City Food last year increased pretax profit 60 % to the equivalent of about 2.7 million on sales of 150 million
She expects both revenue and profit to gain this year
She is almost cavalier about the possibility Vietnam 's reforms will create rivals on her home turf
I do n't mind the competition inside the country she says
I am only afraid that with Vietnam 's poor-quality products we ca n't compete with neighboring countries
The earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area is n't likely to result in wholesale downgrading of bond ratings officials at the two major rating agencies said
Standard & Poor 's Corp. is reviewing debt issued by 12 California counties and there are potential isolated problems said Hyman Grossman a managing director
The agency is preparing a report to be issued today on the earthquake 's impact on the property- and casualty-insurance industry
The only securities so far to be singled out are those issued by Bay View Federal Savings & Loan
Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it is reviewing with an eye toward a possible downgrade the ratings on Bay View Federal bonds long-term deposits and the preferred-stock rating of its parent company Bay View Capital Corp
As for property and casualty insurers Moody 's said preliminary estimates suggest that losses should not have a significant impact on most insurers ' financial condition but it raises concerns about potentially substantial risks longer-term
Losses from the earthquake are expected to be of similar magnitude to those of Hurricane Hugo according to Moody 's
Your Oct. 5 editorial A Democratic Tax Cut contained an error
In the third paragraph it referred to the senators seeking loophole suggestions from lobbyists for various sectors of the economy

Western Digital Corp. reported a net loss of 2.7 million or nine cents a share for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 citing factors as varied as hurricane damage an advance in graphics technology and the strengthening dollar
In the year-ago period the company earned 12.9 million or 45 cents a share on sales of 247 million
Sales for the just-ended period fell to about 225 million the maker of computer parts said
Nonetheless Chairman Roger W. Johnson said he expects the company to be profitable in the current quarter
We are positioned to come through he said noting that the company 's backlog was up from the previous quarter
In its second quarter last year Western Digital earned 12.7 million or 44 cents a share on sales of 258.4 million
Mr. Johnson said Western Digital 's plant in Puerto Rico was affected by Hurricane Hugo losing three days ' production because of the storm which wrecked much of the Caribbean island 's infrastructure
Although the plant itself was n't damaged Mr. Johnson said millions of dollars in first-quarter revenue were lost
The revenue will be regained in the current period he added
There are no plans to initiate a common stock dividend Mr. Johnson said explaining that the board continues to believe shareholders are best served by reinvesting excess cash
Mr. Johnson said the first-quarter loss also heavily reflected a rapid change in graphics technology that left reseller channels with too many of the old computer graphics boards and too few new monitors compatible with the new graphics boards
Western Digital does n't make the monitors
An accelerating move by personal computer manufacturers ' to include advanced graphics capabilities as standard equipment further dampened reseller purchases of Western Digital 's equipment
The other areas of the business storage and microcomputers were very good Mr. Johnson said
He said Western Digital has reacted swiftly to the movement to video graphics array VGA graphics technology from the old enhanced graphics adapter EGA which has a lower resolution standard technology and now is one of the leading producers of these newer units
Other makers of video controller equipment also were caught in the EGA-VGA shift he said but we were able to respond much more quickly
Still Mr. Johnson said our stock is grossly undervalued
He said the company has cut operating expenses by about 10 % over the last few quarters while maintaining research and development at about 8 % to 9 % of sales
As part of its reorganization this week Western Digital has divided its business into two segments storage products including controllers and disk drives and microcomputer products which include graphics communications and peripheral control chips
Graphics communications and peripheral control chips were combined because increasingly multiple functions are being governed by a single chip
Storage which includes computer controllers and 3.5-inch disk drives represents nearly two-thirds of the company 's business
Disk drives which allow a computer to access its memory generated 38 % more revenue in the most recent period compared with the fiscal first quarter a year earlier
Computer parts are getting ever smaller Mr. Johnson said a shrinking that has propelled laptops into position as the fastest-growing segment of the computer business
As smaller and more powerful computers continue to be the focus of the industry he said Western Digital is strengthening development of laptop parts
Next year Western Digital plans to consolidate its operations from 11 buildings in Irvine into two buildings in the same city a new headquarters and a block away a modern 100 million silicon wafer fabrication plant
The plan will help the company in its existing joint manufacturing agreement with AT&T
About half of Western Digital 's business is overseas and Mr. Johnson expects that proportion to continue
Plans to dissolve many of the trade barriers within Europe in 1992 creates significant opportunities for the company he said particularly since Western Digital already manufactures there
Capitalizing on that presence Western Digital is launching a major effort to develop the embryonic reseller market in Europe
Directors of state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro approved a two-step capital-boosting transaction and a change in the bank 's rules that will help it operate more like a private-sector institution
Until now BNL 's top managers and its directors have been appointed by a Treasury decree
But under the bank 's proposed statutes an assembly of shareholders must approve board members
The bank 's chairman and director general who also sit on the board still would be appointed by the Treasury
BNL which is controlled by the Italian Treasury was rocked by the disclosure last month that its Atlanta branch extended more than 3 billion in unauthorized credits to Iraq
The ensuing scandal in which the bank 's management resigned has helped renew calls for privatization or at least an overhaul of Italy 's banking system which is about 80 % state-controlled
In a related move the bank also proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the bank 's new shareholding structure
BNL called a shareholders ' assembly meeting in December to vote on the proposals
BNL has about 75,000 nonvoting shares that are listed on the Milan Stock Exchange
The shares were suspended from trading following disclosure of the Atlanta scandal Consob the stock exchange regulatory body reportedly will decide soon whether to end the trading suspension
Switzerland 's wholesale price index increased 0.3 % in September from August and was up 3.9 % from a year ago marking the first time this year that the index has fallen below 4 % on a year-to-year basis the government reported
The government attributed the 0.3 % month-to-month rise in the index largely to higher energy prices
In August the index was up 0.2 % from the previous month and was up 4.5 % on a year-to-year basis
The wholesale price index based on 1963 as 100 was 180.9 in September

The company said that improved results in its financial-services sector were negated by increased costs in its government contract business lower operating earnings in its commercial-products sector and soft automotive markets
Net was aided by a lower income tax rate
Profit before taxes fell 17 % to 84.4 million from 101.4 million
For the nine months Textron reported net of 182.1 million or 2.06 a share on revenue of 5.41 billion

Textron said that nine-months ' results do n't include earnings of Avdel PLC a British maker of industrial fasteners but do include interest costs of 16.4 million on borrowings related to the proposed purchase of Avdel
A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against the purchase because of Federal Trade Commission concerns that the transaction would reduce competition in the production of two kinds of rivets
For the quarter Textron said aerospace revenue including Bell helicopter and jet-engine manufacture declined 9.8 % to 755.9 million from 838.3 million an indication of slowing government defense work
As the Hunt brothers ' personal bankruptcy cases sputter into their second year Minpeco S.A. has proposed a deal to settle its huge claim against the troubled Texas oil men
But the plan only threatens to heighten the tension and confusion already surrounding the cases that were filed in September 1988
The Peruvian mineral concern 's 251 million claim stems from 1988 jury award in a case stemming from the brothers ' alleged attempts to corner the 1979-80 silver market
Minpeco now says it is willing to settle for up to 65.7 million from each brother although the actual amount would probably be much less
Although the proposal must be approved by federal Judge Harold C. Abramson W. Herbert Hunt has agreed to the Peruvian mineral concern 's proposal
Nelson Bunker Hunt is considering it although his attorney says he wo n't do it if the proposal jeopardizes a tentative settlement he has reached with the Internal Revenue Service which claims the brothers owe 1 billion in back taxes and is by far the biggest creditor in both cases
The tentative agreement between the IRS and Nelson Bunker Hunt is awaiting U.S. Justice Department approval
Under it the former billionaire 's assets would be liquidated with the IRS getting 80 % of the proceeds and the rest being divided among other creditors including Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. which is seeking repayment of a 36 million loan
A similiar proposal has been made in the W. Herbert Hunt case although he and the IRS are at odds over the size of the non-dischargable debt he would have to pay to the government from future earnings
In both cases Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover have been fighting ferociously over their shares of the pie
With support from the IRS Manufacturers Hanover has filed suit asking Judge Abramson to subordinate Minpeco 's claim to those of Manufacturer Hanover and the IRS
Minpeco has threatened a volcano of litigation if the Manufacturers Hanover Corp. unit attempts to force such a plan through the court
Minpeco said it would n't pursue such litigation if its settlement plan in the W. Herbert Hunt case is approved by Judge Abramson who will consider the proposal at a hearing next week
Minpeco attorney Thomas Gorman decribed the plan as one step toward an overall settlement of the W. Herbert Hunt case but Hugh Ray attorney for Manufacturers Hanover called it silly and said he would fight it in court
The thing is so fluid right now that there 's really no way to say what will happen says Justice Department attorney Grover Hartt III who represents the IRS in the case
Developments like this are hard to predict
Banc One Corp. said it agreed in principle to buy five branch offices from Trustcorp Inc. Toledo Ohio following the planned merger of Trustcorp into Society Corp. Cleveland
The five offices in Erie and Ottawa counties in northern Ohio have total assets of about 88 million Banc One said
The purchase price will be established after Banc One has an opportunity to study the quality of the assets Banc One said
Society Corp. already has branches in the area and selling the Trustcorp offices could avoid a problem with regulators over excessive concentration of banking in the two counties after the merger of Trustcorp into Society according to industry sources
The merger is scheduled to take place in the 1990 first quarter
Stock-market fears and relatively more attractive interest rates pushed money-market mutual fund assets up 6.07 billion in the latest week the sharpest increase in almost two years
The 473 funds tracked by the Investment Company Institute a Washington-based trade group rose to 356.1 billion a record
The 6.07 billion increase was the strongest weekly inflow since January 1988
The increase was spread fairly evenly among all three types of funds
Individual investors represented in the general-purpose and broker-dealer fund categories pulled money from the stock market after its big drop last Friday and put the money into funds said Jacob Dreyer vice president and chief economist of the Institute
Insitutional investors on the other hand reacted to the steep decline in yields on direct money-market instruments following the stock-market decline last Friday Mr. Dreyer said
Yields on money funds dropped in the week ended Tuesday according to Donoghue 's Money Fund Report a Holliston Mass. newsletter
The average seven-day compounded yield fell to 8.55 % from 8.60 % the week earlier Donoghue 's said
At the auction of six-month U.S. Treasury bills on Monday the average yield fell to 7.61 % from 7.82 %
Likewise certificates of deposit on average posted lower yields in the week ended Tuesday
The 142 institutional-type money funds rose 2.23 billion to 85.49 billion
The 235 general-purpose funds increased 2.53 billion to 116.56 billion while 96 broker-dealer funds increased 1.3 billion to 154.05 billion
Domestic lending for real estate and property development was the source of Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd. 's most recent spate of financial troubles the institution 's executive chairman Mohamed Basir Ismail said
Speaking to reporters this week after Bank Bumiputra 's shareholders approved a rescue plan Tan Sri Basir said heavy lending to the property sector rocked the bank when property prices in Malaysia plummeted in 1984-85
He said the bank could n't wait any longer for prices to recover and for borrowers to service their loans
So the bank 's board decided to make 1.23 billion Malaysian dollars 457 million in provisions for interest payments from loans previously recorded as revenue but never actually received by the bank and to submit a bailout package to replenish the bank 's paid-up capital
The predicament he added was similar to the Hong Kong 1982-83 property-price collapse which exposed the involvement of Bank Bumiputra 's former subsidiary in the colony in the largest banking scandal in Malaysia 's history
The subsidiary Bumiputra Malaysia Finance Ltd. was left with 2.26 billion in bad loans made to Hong Kong property speculators
Both episodes wiped out Bank Bumiputra 's shareholders ' funds
Each time the bank 's 90 % shareholder Petroliam Nasional Bhd. or Petronas the national oil company has been called upon to rescue the institution
In five years Petronas which became the dominant shareholder in a 1984 rescue exercise has spent about 3.5 billion to prop up the troubled bank
Tan Sri Basir said the capital restructuring plan has been approved by Malaysia 's Capital Issues Committee and central bank
Malaysia 's High Court is expected to approve the plan
Once the plan is approved Tan Sri Basir said most of Bank Bumiputra 's nonperforming loans will have been fully provided for and the bank will be on track to report a pretax profit of between 160 million and 170 million for the fiscal year ending March 31
For the previous financial year the bank would have reported a pretax profit of 168 million if it had n't made provisions for the nonperforming loans he said
Malaysia 's Banking Secrecy Act prohibited the bank from identifying delinquent borrowers said Tan Sri Basir
But public documents indicate 10 % or more of the bank 's provisions were made for foregone interest on a 200 million loan to Malaysia 's dominant political party the United Malays National Organization to build its convention and headquarters complex in Kuala Lumpur
The loan to UMNO was made in September 1983
We lent a lot of money all over the place said Tan Sri Basir who refused to discuss the bank 's outstanding loans to As well as the 1.23 billion in provisions announced on Oct. 6 the restructuring package covers an additional 450 million in provisions made in earlier years but never reflected in a reduction of the bank 's paid-up capital
At the end of the exercise the cash injection from Petronas will increase the bank 's paid-up capital to 1.15 billion after virtually being wiped out by the new provisions
Heidi Ehman might have stepped from a recruiting poster for young Republicans
White 24 years old a singer in her church choir she symbolizes a generation that gave its heart and its vote to Ronald Reagan
I felt kind of safe she says
No longer
When the Supreme Court opened the door this year to new restrictions on abortion Ms. Ehman opened her mind to Democratic politics
Then a political novice she stepped into a whirl of pro-choice marches house parties and fund-raisers
Now she leads a grassroots abortion-rights campaign in Passaic County for pro-choice Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Florio
This is one where I cross party lines she says rejecting the anti-abortion stance of Rep. Florio 's opponent Reagan-Republican Rep. James Courter
People my age thought it was n't going to be an issue
Now it has especially for people my age
Polls bear out this warning but after a decade of increased Republican influence here the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for Mr. Courter
Unless he closes the gap Republicans risk losing not only the governorship but also the assembly next month
Going into the 1990s the GOP is paying a price for the same conservative social agenda that it used to torment Democrats in the past
This change comes less from a shift in public opinion which has n't changed much on abortion over the past decade than in the boundaries of the debate
New Jersey 's own highest court remains a liberal bulwark against major restrictions on abortion but the U.S. Supreme Court ruling Webster vs. Missouri has engaged voters across the nation who had been insulated from the issue
Before July pro-choice voters could safely make political decisions without focusing narrowly on abortion
Now the threat of further restrictions adds a new dimension bringing an upsurge in political activity by abortion-rights forces
A recent pro-choice rally in Trenton drew thousands and in a major reversal Congress is defying a presidential veto and demanding that Medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest
If Webster had n't happened you would n't be here Linda Bowker tells a reporter in the Trenton office of the National Organization for Women
We could have shouted from the rooftops about Courter and no one would have heard us
New Jersey is a proving ground for this aggressive women's-rights movement this year
The infusion of activists can bring a clash of cultures
In Cherry Hill the National Abortion Rights Action League whose goal is to sign up 50,000 pro-choice voters targets a union breakfast to build labor support for its cause
The league organizers seem more a fit with a convention next door of young aerobics instructors in leotards than the beefy union leaders I wish I could go work out says a slim activist
A labor chief speaks sardonically of having to man and woman Election Day phones
No age group is more sensitive than younger voters like Ms. Ehman
A year ago this fall New Jersey voters under 30 favored George Bush by 56 % to 39 % over Michael Dukakis according to a survey then by Rutgers University 's Eagleton Institute
A matching Eagleton-Newark Star Ledger poll last month showed a complete reversal
Voters in the same age group backed Democrat Florio 55 % to 29 % over Republican Courter
Abortion alone ca n't explain this shift but New Jersey is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a candidate
By a 2-to-1 ratio voters appear more at ease with Mr. Florio 's stance on abortion and polls indicate his lead widens when the candidates are specifically linked to the issue
The times are my times says Mr. Florio
The Camden County congressman still carries himself with a trademark I'm-coming-down-your-throat intensity but at a pause in Newark 's Columbus Day parade recently he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city 's old Italian-American ward
After losing by fewer than 1,800 votes in the 1981 governor 's race he has prepared himself methodically for this moment including deciding in recent years he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for Medicaid abortions
If you 're going to be consistent and say it is a constitutionally protected right he asks how are you going to say an upscale woman who can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not Mr. Courter by comparison seems a shadow of the confident hawk who defended Oliver North before national cameras at Iran-Contra hearings two years ago
Looking back he says he erred by stating his personal opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he would n't impose his views on policy as governor
It is a distinction that satisfies neither side in the debate
He does n't know himself Kathy Stanwick of the Abortion Rights League says of Mr. Courter 's position
Even abortion opponents however angry with Mr. Florio ca n't hide their frustration with the Republican 's ambivalence
He does n't want to lead the people says Richard Traynor president of New Jersey Right to Life
Moreover by stepping outside the state 's pro-choice tradition Mr. Courter aggravates fears that he is too conservative as well on more pressing concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment
He hurt himself further this summer by bringing homosexual issues into the debate and by wavering on this issue and abortion he has weakened his credibility in what is already a mean-spirited campaign on both sides
Elected to Congress in 1978 the 48-year-old Mr. Courter is part of a generation of young conservatives who were once very much in the lead of the rightward shift under Mr. Reagan
Like many of his colleagues he did n't serve in Vietnam in the 1960s yet embraced a hawkish defense and foreign policy even voting against a 1984 resolution critical of the U.S. mining of Nicaraguan harbors
Jack Kemp and the writers Irving Kristol and George Gilder were influences and Mr. Courter 's own conservative credentials proved useful to the current New Jersey GOP governor Thomas Kean in the 1981 Republican primary here
The same partnership is now crucial to Mr. Courter 's fortunes but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate pro-choice Gov. Kean
While the Warren County congressman pursued an anti-government anti-tax agenda in Washington Gov. Kean was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of New Jersey 's budget in his eight years in office
Kean forces play down any differences with Mr. Courter but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against government
Mr. Courter 's free-market plan to bring down auto insurance rates met criticism from Gov. Kean 's own insurance commissioner
Mr. Courter is further hobbled by a record of votes opposed to government regulation on behalf of consumers
Fluent in Spanish from his days in the Peace Corps Mr. Courter actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head
He is warm and polished before a Puerto Rican Congress in Asbury Park
Yet minutes after promising to appoint Hispanics to high posts in state government he is unable to say whether he has ever employed any in his congressional office
I do n't think we do now he says
I think we did
Asked the same question after his appearance Democrat Florio identifies a staff member by name and explains her whereabouts today
When he is presented with a poster celebrating the organization 's 20th anniversary he recognizes a photograph of one of the founders and recalls time spent together in Camden
Details and Camden are essential Florio
Elected to Congress as a Watergate baby in 1974 he ran for governor three years later
In the opinion of many he has n't stopped running since even though he declined a rematch with Gov. Kean in 1985
His base in South Jersey and on the House Energy and Commerce Committee helped him sustain a network of political-action committees to preserve his edge
With limited budgets for television in a high-priced market Mr. Florio 's higher recognition than his rival is a major advantage
More than ever his pro-consumer and pro-environment record is in sync with the state
Auto insurance rates are soaring
A toxic-waste-dump fire destroyed part of an interstate highway this summer
In Monmouth an important swing area Republican freeholders now run on a slogan promising to keep the county clean and green
Mr. Florio savors this vindication but at age 52 the congressman is also a product of his times and losses
He speaks for the death penalty as if reading from Exodus 21 to increase state revenue he focuses not on taxes but on audits to cut waste
Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter 's team and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s
Appealing to a young audience he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead
The lyric chosen long strange night may be an apt footnote to television spots by both candidates intended to portray each other as a liar
The Democratic lawmaker fits a pattern of younger reformers arising out of old machines but his ties to Camden remain a sore point because of the county 's past corruption
His campaign hierarchy is chosen from elsewhere in the state and faced with criticism of a sweetheart bank investment he has so far blunted the issue by donating the bulk of his profits to his alma mater Trenton State College
Mr. Florio 's forcefulness on the abortion issue after the Webster ruling divides some of his old constituency
Pasquale Pignatelli an unlikely but enthusiastic pipe major in an Essex County Irish bagpipe band speaks sadly of Mr. Florio
I am a devout Catholic says Mr. Pignatelli a 40-year-old health officer
I ca n't support him because of abortion
Bill Wames Sr. 72 is Catholic too but unfazed by Mr. Florio 's stand on abortion

Consumer prices rose a surprisingly moderate 0.2 % in September pushed up mostly by a jump in clothing costs the Labor Department reported
Energy costs which drove wholesale prices up sharply during the month continued to decline at the retail level pulling down transportation and helping to ease housing costs
The report was the brightest news the financial markets had seen since before the stock market plunged more than 190 points last Friday
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied on the news closing 39.55 points higher at 2683.20
Bond prices also jumped as traders appeared to read the data as a sign that interest rates may fall
But many economists were not nearly as jubilant
The climb in wholesale energy prices is certain to push up retail energy prices in the next few months they warned
They also said the dollar is leveling off after a rise this summer that helped to reduce the prices of imported goods
I think inflation is going to pick up through the fall said Joel Popkin a specialist on inflation who runs an economic consulting firm here
It has been in what I would describe as a lull for the past several months
We 've had whopping declines in consumer energy prices in each of the past three months and at the wholesale level those are fully behind us now said Jay Woodworth chief domestic economist at Bankers Trust Co. in New York
Because wholesale energy prices shot up by a steep 6.5 % last month many analysts expected energy prices to rise at the consumer level too
As a result many economists were expecting the consumer price index to increase significantly more than it did
But retail energy prices declined 0.9 % in September
Though analysts say competition will probably hold down increases in retail energy prices many expect some of the wholesale rise to be passed along to the consumer before the end of the year
Still some analysts insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind
It increasingly appears that 1987-88 was a temporary inflation blip and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem argued Edward Yardeni chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York
In both 1987 and 1988 consumer prices rose 4.4 %
A run-up in world oil prices last winter sent consumer prices soaring at a 6.7 % annual rate in the first five months of this year but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the annual rate back down to 4.4 %
Mr. Yardeni predicted that world business competition will continue to restrain prices
The bottom line is it seems to me that the economic environment has become very very competitve for a lot of businesses he said
Back in 1987-88 business was operating at fairly tight capacity so businesses felt they could raise prices
Now he said a slowdown in economic activity has slackened demand
The mild inflation figures renewed investors ' hopes that the Federal Reserve will ease its interest-rate stance
The steep climb in producer prices reported last Friday fostered pessimism about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market 's 6.9 % plunge that day
In the past several days however the U.S. 's central bank has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets
Analysts say Fed policy makers have been wary of relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy
Excluding the volatile categories of energy and food leaving what some economists call the core inflation rate consumer prices still rose only 0.2 % in September
Transportation costs actually fell 0.5 % and housing costs gained only 0.1 %
Apparel prices rocketed up 1.7 % but that was after three months of declines
Medical costs continued their steep ascent rising 0.8 % after four consecutive months of 0.7 % increases
Car prices another area that contributed to the steep rise in the wholesale index last month still showed declines at the consumer level
They dropped 0.4 % as dealers continued to offer rebates to attract customers
Food prices rose 0.2 % for the second month in a row far slower than the monthly rises earlier in the year
Separately the Labor Department reported that average weekly earnings rose 0.3 % in September after adjusting for inflation following a 0.7 % decline in August
All the numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations
Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department 's consumer price index for September
After watching interest in the sport plummet for years the ski industry is trying to give itself a lift
Across the country resorts are using everything from fireworks to classical-music concerts to attract new customers
Some have built health spas business centers and shopping villages so visitors have more to do than ski
And this week the industry 's efforts will go national for the first time when it unveils a 7 million advertising campaign
Such efforts unheard of only a few years ago are the latest attempts to revive the sagging 1.76 billion U.S. ski industry
Since the start of the decade lift-ticket sales have grown only 3 % a year on average compared with 16 % annual growth rates in the '60s and '70s
Last season lift-ticket sales fell for the first time in seven years
By some estimates nearly a fourth of all U.S. ski areas have been forced to shut down since the early '80s
Competition and mounting insurance and equipment costs have been the undoing of many resorts
But another big problem has been the aging of baby boomers
Skiing after all has mainly been for the young and daring and many baby boomers have outgrown skiing or have too many family responsibilities to stick with the sport
In its new ad campaign created by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles Inc. Chicago the ski industry is trying to change its image as a sport primarily for young white people
One 60-second TV spot features a diverse group of skiers gracefully gliding down sun-drenched slopes senior citizens minorities families with children even a blind skier
Ski school is great cries out a tot bundled in a snowsuit as he plows down a bunny slope
You 'll never know 'til you try says a black skier
We used to show some hot-dog skier in his twenties or thirties going over the edge of a cliff says Kathe Dillmann a spokeswoman for the United Ski Industries Association the trade group sponsoring the campaign
Ski promotions have traditionally avoided the touchy issue of safety
But the new commercials deal with it indirectly by showing a woman smiling as she tries to get up from a fall
We wanted to show it 's okay if you fall says Ms. Dillmann
Most people think if you slip you 'll wind up in a body cast
The ad campaign represents an unusual spirit of cooperation among resorts and ski equipment makers normally they only run ads hyping their own products and facilities
But in these crunch times for the ski industry some resorts such as the Angel Fire Red River and Taos ski areas in New Mexico have even started shuttle-busing skiers to each other 's slopes and next year plan to sell tickets good for all local lifts
Many resorts also are focusing more on the service side of their business
Since 40 % of skiers are parents many slopes are building nurseries expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids
Vail Colo. now has a playland that looks like an old mining town kids can ski through and pan for fool 's gold
For 15 they can enjoy their own nightly entertainment with dinner without mom and dad
A few years ago parents usually had to hire a sitter or take turns skiing while one spouse stayed with the children
Most parents who had to go through that never came back says Michael Shannon president of Vail Associates Inc. which owns and operates the Vail and nearby Beaver Creek resorts
To make skiing more convenient for time-strapped visitors several resorts are buying or starting their own travel agencies
In one phone call ski buffs can make hotel and restaurant reservations buy lift tickets rent ski equipment and sign up for lessons
And resorts are adding other amenities such as pricey restaurants health spas and vacation packages with a twist
During Winter Carnival week for example visitors at Sunday River in Maine can take a hot-air balloon ride
People these days want something else to do besides ski and sit in the bar says Don Borgeson executive director of Angel Fire N.M. 's Chamber of Commerce
The ski industry hopes to increase the number of skiers by 3.5 million to about 21.7 million in the next five years with its latest ads and promotions
But some think that 's being overly optimistic
For one thing it may be tough to attract people because skiing is still expensive a lift ticket can cost up to 35 a day and equipment prices are rising
And most vacationers still prefer a warm climate for their winter excursions
An American Express Co. survey of its travel agents revealed that only 34 % believe their clients will pick a trip this winter based on the availability of winter sports as opposed to 69 % who think that warm-weather sports will be the deciding factor
Even if they could bring in that many new skiers I do n't know if the industry could handle that kind of an increase says I. William Berry editor and publisher of the Ski Industry Letter in Katonah N.Y
Most people will come on the weekend the slopes will be overcrowded and then these new skiers wo n't come back
They did n't play the third game of the World Series on Tuesday night as scheduled and they did n't play it on Wednesday or Thursday either
But you knew that did n't you They are supposed to play the game next Tuesday in Candlestick Park here
The theory is that the stadium damaged by Tuesday 's earthquake will be repaired by then and that people will be able to get there
Like just about everything else that remains to be seen
Aftershocks could intervene
But at least the law of averages should have swung to the favorable side
It may seem trivial to worry about the World Series amid the destruction to the Bay Area wrought by Tuesday 's quake but the name of this column is On Sports so I feel obliged to do so
You might be interested to know that baseball not survival appeared to be the first thought of most of the crowd of 60,000-odd that had gathered at Candlestick at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday a half-hour before game time when the quake struck
As soon as the tremor passed many people spontaneously arose and cheered as though it had been a novel kind of pre-game show
One fan seated several rows in front of the open upper-deck auxiliary press section where I was stationed faced the assembled newsies and laughingly shouted We arranged that just for you guys I thought and I 'm sure others did You should n't have bothered
I 'd slept through my only previous brush with natural disaster a tornado 15 or so summers ago near Traverse City Mich. so I was unprepared for one reaction to such things the urge to talk about them
Perhaps primed by the daily diet of radio and TV reporters thrusting microphones into people 's faces and asking how they feel about one calamity or another fellow reporters and civilians who spied my press credential were eager to chat
It felt like I was on a station platform and a train went by said one man describing my own reaction
A women said she saw the park 's light standards sway
A man said he saw the upper rim undulate
I saw neither
Dictates of good sense to the contrary not withstanding the general inclination was to believe that the disturbance would be brief and that ball would be played
I was near the top of the stadium and saw a steel girder bow six feet from where I sat but I stayed put for 10 or 15 minutes confessed a friend
I guess I thought This is the World Series and I 'm not gon na wimp out Here in the Global Village though folks do not stay uninformed for long
Electrical power was out in still-daylighted Candlestick Park but battery-operated radios and television sets were plentiful
Within a few minutes the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear
Its Richter Scale measurement was reported as 6.5 then 6.9 then 7.0
A section of the Bay Bridge had collapsed as had a part of Interstate Highway 880 in Oakland
People had died
At 5:40 p.m. scheduled game time having passed some fans chanted Let 's Play Ball
No longer innocent they qualified as fools
The stadium was ordered evacuated soon afterward the announcement made over police bullhorns cited the power outage but it later was revealed that there also had been damage of the sort reported by my friend
Outside I spotted two young men lugging blocks of concrete
Pieces of Candlestick they said
The crowd remained good natured even bemused
TV reporters interviewed fans in the parking lots while a few feet away others watched the interviews on their portable TVs
The only frenzy I saw was commercial Booths selling World Series commemorative stamps and dated postmarks were besieged by fledgling speculators who saw future profit in the items
The traffic jam out of the park was monumental
It took me a half-hour to move 10 feet from my parking spot in an outer lot to an aisle and an additional hour to reach an inner roadway a half-block away
The six-mile trip to my airport hotel that had taken 20 minutes earlier in the day took more than three hours
At my hotel the Westin power was out some interior plaster had broken loose and there had been water damage but little else
With Garpian randomness a hotel across the street the Amfac had been hit harder A large sheet of its concrete facade and several window balconies were torn away
The Westin staff had kindly set out lighted candles in the ballroom prepared a cold-cuts buffet and passed around pillows and blankets
I fell asleep on the lobby floor next to a man wearing a Chicago Cubs jacket
I expected him to say I told you so but he already was snoring
The journalistic consensus was that the earthquake made the World Series seem unimportant
My response was that sports rarely are important only diverting and the quake merely highlighted that fact
Should the rest of the Series be played at all Sure
The quake and baseball were n't related unlike the massacre of athletes that attended the 1972 Olympics
That heavily politicized event learned nothing from the horrifying experience and seems doomed to repeat it
Two ironies intrude
This has been widely dubbed the BART Series after the local subway line and the Bay Bridge Series
Flags fly at half-staff for the death of Bart Giamatti the late baseball commissioner and now the Bay Bridge lies in ruins
A Series that was shaping up as the dullest since the one-sided Detroit-over-San Diego go of 1984 has become memorable in the least fortunate way
Still its edge is lost
It now will be played mostly for the record and should be wrapped up as quickly as possible without off days
And I will never again complain about a rainout
The disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at Campeau Corp. has offered commercial banks a golden opportunity to play a greater role in financing billion-dollar takeovers
But two big New York banks seem to have kicked those chances away for the moment with the embarrassing failure of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. to deliver 7.2 billion in bank financing for a leveraged buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp
For more than a decade banks have been pressing Congress and banking regulators for expanded powers to act like securities firms in playing Wall Street 's lucrative takeover game from giving mergers advice all the way to selling and trading high-yield junk bonds
Those expanded powers reached their zenith in July when Bankers Trust New York Corp. provided mergers advice an equity investment and bank loans for the 3.65 billion leveraged buy-out of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc
One of the major selling points used by Los Angeles financier Alfred Checchi in getting the takeover approved was that the deal did n't include any junk bonds
That was seen as an advantage in lobbying airline employees and Washington regulators for approval of the contested takeover
All 3.35 billion in debt for the deal was supplied by banks
Charles Nathan co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Salomon Brothers Inc. says it is natural for banks to try to expand beyond their bread-and-butter business of providing senior debt for buy-outs
But the UAL collapse he says may tell you it 's not going to work that easily
David Batchelder a mergers adviser in La Jolla Calif. who aided Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis on the bids which put both UAL and NWA in play as takeover candidates this year says that banks have been preparing to play a larger and larger role in acquisition financing
Mr. Batchelder says that in the past banks would normally have loaned 65 % of a total buy-out price with the loans secured by the target company 's assets
Another 20 % of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to investors of junk bonds which offer less security and typically carry higher yields than bank loans
Mr. Checchi 's purchase of NWA Mr. Batchelder notes was probably the most aggressive to date with bank debt at 85 % of the purchase price
But Mr. Batchelder says that Citicorp 's failure to deliver on its promise to raise the UAL bank debt for a labor-management buy-out group is very distressing to potential users of a highly-confident letter from commercial banks
His client Mr. Davis used just such a letter from Citicorp in pursuing UAL Citicorp later agreed to work with a competing UAL buy-out group
Executives of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan declined to comment on either the UAL situation or on the changing nature of banks ' role in financing takeovers
In the wake of Campeau 's problems prices of junk bonds tumbled throwing into doubt the ability of corporate acquirers to finance large takeovers with the help of junk bond sales
Mark Solow senior managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. says the falloff in junk bonds may yet open new business opportunities to banks in structuring takeovers
But he warns that banks will have to have enough discipline not to make loans that are too risky
In fact Manufacturers Hanover said in its third-quarter earnings report that fees from syndicating loans to other banks dropped 48 % to 21 million
We did n't take part in a lot of deals because their credit quality was poor says a bank spokesman
James B. Lee head of syndications and private placements at Chemical Banking Corp. said he believes banks can still make a credible offer of one-stop shopping for takeover finance
As evidence he cites yesterday 's arrangement for the final financing of a 3 billion bid for American Medical International Inc. in which Chemical served as both the lead bank and an equity investor
Beyond the current weakness in the junk bond market banks have another advantage over investment banks in financing contested takeovers
Arthur Fleischer Jr. a takeover lawyer at Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson notes that a political and emotional bias has developed against junk bonds
One hostile bidder who deliberately avoided using junk bonds was Paramount Communications Inc. in its initial offer to acquire Time Inc. for 10.7 billion or 175 a share
A Paramount spokesman says that decision was based on the financial not political drawbacks of junk bonds
But some observers believe Paramount Chairman Martin Davis wanted to avoid the possible taint of being perceived as a corporate raider in his controversial bid for Time
In the end Mr. Davis used junk bonds so that he could raise Paramount 's bid to 200 a share
Some Monday-morning quarterbacks said the initial lower bid without junk bonds was a factor in his losing the company
Time eluded Paramount by acquiring Warner Communications Inc
The success of the NWA financing and the failure of the UAL deal also seem to highlight the important new role in takeover financing being played by Japanese banks
Japanese banks accounted for 50 % of the NWA bank debt according to a report by Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
But it was broad-scale rejection by Japanese banks that helped seal the fate of the attempt to buy UAL
Citicorp and Chase are attempting to put together a new lower bid
Takanori Mizuno chief economist of the Institute for Financial Affairs Inc. a Tokyo research center on finance and economics says The junk bond market became very jittery and there 's a fear of a coming recession and the possible bankruptcy of LBO companies
Harley-Davidson Inc. filed suit in federal court here alleging that a group that holds 6.2 % of its stock made false deceptive and misleading statements in recent regulatory filings and public announcements
Harley-Davidson 's complaint claims that the group led by investor Malcolm I. Glazer violated securities laws by failing to disclose plans to purchase 15 % of the company 's shares outstanding and that when the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filing eventually was made it did n't disclose the group 's alleged earlier violation of the so-called prior-notice requirements of the law
Mr. Glazer could n't immediately be reached to comment
But when Harley last week publicly questioned the legality of the group 's filing procedures the Rochester N.Y. investor said we complied with every law and he denied any wrongdoing
The Glazer group said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in early October that it may seek a controlling interest in Harley-Davidson or seek representation on the company 's board
Harley has said it does n't intend to be acquired by the Glazer group or any other party
Inland Steel Industries Inc. battered by lower volume and higher costs posted a 75 % drop in third-quarter earnings
The nation 's fourth-largest steelmaker earned 18.3 million or 43 cents a share compared with 61 million or 1.70 a share a year earlier when the industry was enjoying peak demand and strong pricing
Sales fell to 981.2 million from 1.02 billion
The earnings also mark a significant drop from the second quarter 's 45.3 million or 1.25 a share
Moreover the earnings were well below analysts ' expectations of about 1.16 a share
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Inland closed yesterday at 35.875 a share down 1
The company attributed the earnings drop to lower volume related to seasonal demand and the soft consumer durable market especially in the automotive sector
However the company also lost orders because of prolonged labor talks in the second quarter
Third-quarter shipments slipped 7 % from the year-ago period and 17 % from this year 's second quarter
Profit of steel shipped for the company 's steel segment slid to 26 a ton from 66 a ton a year earlier and 57 a ton a quarter earlier
Analysts noted that the disappointing results do n't reflect lower prices for steel products
Charles Bradford an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets said higher prices for galvanized and cold-rolled products offset lower prices for bar hot-rolled and structural steel
Structural steel which primarily serves the construction market was especially hurt by a 15 % price drop Mr. Bradford said
The company said its integrated steel sector was also hurt by higher raw material repair and maintenance and labor costs
The increased labor costs became effective Aug. 1 under terms of the four-year labor agreement with the United Steelworkers union
Meanwhile the company 's service center segment which saw operating profit drop to 11.5 million from 30.7 million a year ago experienced much of the same demand and cost problems as well as start-up costs associated with a coil processing facility in Chicago and an upgraded computer information system
Inland Chairman Frank W. Luerssen said the company 's short-term outlook is clouded by uncertainties in the economy and financial markets
However he noted that steel mill bookings are up from early summer levels and that he expects the company to improve its cost performance in the fourth quarter
In the first nine months profit was 113 million or 3.04 a share on sales of 3.19 billion compared with 204.5 million or 5.76 a share on sales of 3.03 billion a year earlier
The seismic activity of a financial market bears a resemblance to the seismic activity of the earth
When things are quiet low volatility the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately
However when powerful forces start shaking the market 's structure the more earthquake-resistant it is the better its chance for survival
America 's financial markets do not yet have all the required modern features required to make them fully aftershock-resistant
Investors lack equal access to the markets ' trading arena and its information
That structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity
And liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks
In today 's markets specialists on the New York Stock Exchange and upstairs market makers in the over-the-counter market are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process
When they halt trading all market liquidity is gone
And when any component of the market cash futures or options loses liquidity the price discovery system the way prices are determined becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time
Last Friday the 13th as well as two years ago this week the markets became unlinked
When that happened seismic tremors of fear much like the shock waves created by an earthquake coursed through the market and increased the market 's volatility
Lack of important needed information can cause fear
Fear is the father of panic
Panic frequently results in irrational behavior
And in financial markets irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe
When market tremors start it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve buy and sell orders at various prices be made available to all not just to market makers
Because of a lack of information and access many investors including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed because of their ignorance of important market information
To add aftershock-damping power to America 's markets a modern electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena and the information that would automatically accompany such access by investors particularly institutional investors
Contrary to some opinions the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole
What market makers provide is immediacy a very valuable service
Liquidity is not a service
It is a market attribute the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news
Market makers buy what investors wish to sell their business is reselling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors and at a profit
As a result while any one customer may purchase immediacy by selling to a market maker which is micro-liquidity for the investor the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction The unwanted position is still an unwanted position only the identity of the seller has changed
In fact it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market makers a result of some post-1987 crash studies also increases market volatility since the more securities are held by market makers at any given time the more selling pressure is overhanging the market
In an open electronic system any investor wishing to pay for real-time access to the trading arena through a registered broker-dealer would be able to see the entire supply-demand curve buy and sell orders at each price entered by dealers and investors alike and to enter and execute orders
Current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants not just those of intermediaries who become extremely risk-averse during times of crisis
Investors and professionals alike would compete on the level playing field Congress sought and called a national market system not yet achieved almost 15 years ago when it passed the Securities Reform Act of 1975
Last Friday 's market gyrations did not result in severe aftershocks
Were we smart or just lucky I 'm not certain
But I am sure we need to maximize our earthquake protection by making certain that our market structures let investors add their mighty shock-damping power to our nation 's markets
Mr. Peake is chairman of his own consulting company in Englewood N.J
NOW YOU SEE IT now you do n't
The recession that is
The economy 's stutter steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up
So often are government statistics revised that they seem to resemble a spinning weather vane
For the past seven years investors have had the wind at their backs in the form of a generally growing economy
Some may have forgotten and some younger ones may never have experienced what it 's like to invest during a recession
Different tactics are called for as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher
For those investors who believe or fear that 1990 will be a recession year many economists and money managers agree on steps that can be taken to lower the risks in a portfolio
In a nutshell pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in defensive industries
A heavy dose of cash is prescribed along with a heavier-than-usual allotment to bonds preferably government bonds
It 's tempting to think these defensive steps can be delayed until a recession is clearly at hand
But that may not be possible because recessions often take investors by surprise
They always seem to come a bit later than you expect
When they do hit they hit fast says David A. Wyss chief financial economist at the Data Resources division of McGraw-Hill Inc
Though he himself does n't expect a recession soon Mr. Wyss advises people who do that the best thing to be in is long that is 20-year to 30-year Treasury bonds
The reason is simple Mr. Wyss says Interest rates almost always decline during recession
As surely as a seesaw tilts falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds
They are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do
That effect holds true for both short-term and long-term bonds
But short-term bonds ca n't rise too much because everyone knows they will be redeemed at a preset price fairly soon
Long-term bonds with many years left before maturity swing more widely in price
But not just any bonds will do
Corporate bonds are usually not a good bet in a recession Mr. Wyss says
As times get tougher investors fret about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts
This hurts the price of corporate bonds
Also he notes most corporate bonds are callable
That means that a corporation after a specified amount of time has passed can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value plus in some cases a sweetener
When interest rates have dropped it makes sense for corporations to do just that they then save on interest costs
But the investors are left stranded with money to reinvest at a time when interest rates are puny
If corporate bonds are bad in recessions junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all
It 's an absolute necessity to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing says Avner Arbel professor of finance at Cornell University
Such bonds are very sensitive to the downside and this could be a disaster
Municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government
During an economic slump local tax revenues often go down raising the risks associated with at least some municipals
And like corporates many municipal bonds are callable
But a few experts going against the consensus do n't think bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the offing
One of these is Jeffrey L. Beach director of research for Underwood Neuhaus & Co. a brokerage house in Houston who thinks that we 're either in a recession or about to go into one
What 's more he thinks this could be a nastier recession than usual Once the downturn comes it 's going to be very hard to reverse
Investors he advises should be cautious holding fewer stocks than usual and also shunning bonds
Because he sees a 5 % to 6 % base rate of inflation in the economy he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon
Instead Mr. Beach says investors probably should be carrying a very high level of cash by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and Treasury bills
Greg Confair president of Sigma Financial Inc. in Allentown Pa. also recommends that investors go heavily for cash
He is n't sure a recession is coming but says the other likely alternative reignited inflation is just as bad
This late in an expansion the economy tends to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession Mr. Confair says
The Federal Reserve Board 's plan for a soft landing he says requires the Fed to navigate an ever-narrowing corridor
A soft landing is n't something that can be achieved once and for all Mr. Confair adds
It has to be engineered over and over again month after month
He believes that the task facing Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is so difficult that it resembles juggling a double-bladed ax and a buzz saw
And in a sense that 's the kind of task individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks the mainstay of most serious investors ' portfolios
It comes down to a question of whether to try to time the market
For people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad stocks have been rewarding long-term investments
Most studies show that buy-and-hold investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of 9 % to 10 % including both dividends and price appreciation
That 's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid
Moreover because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming some analysts think investors should n't even worry too much about timing
Trying to time the economy is a mistake says David Katz chief investment officer of Value Matrix Management Inc. in New York
Mr. Katz notes that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years
Investors who listened and lightened up on stocks have just hurt themselves he says
Mr. Katz adds that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about 70 % of the time to beat a buy-and-hold strategy
Frequent trading runs up high commission costs
And the in-and-outer might miss the sudden spurts that account for much of the stock market 's gains over time
Still few investors are able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession is coming
After all in all five recessions since 1960 stocks declined
According to Ned Davis president of Ned Davis Research Inc. in Nokomis Fla. the average drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 21 % and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started
By the time a recession is official two consecutive quarters of declining gross national product much of the damage to stocks has already been done and in the typical case the recession is already half over
About six months before a recession ends stocks typically begin to rise again as investors anticipate a recovery
The average recession lasts about a year
Unfortunately though recessions vary enough in length so that the average ca n't reliably be used to guide investors in timing stock sales or purchases
But whatever their advice about timing none of these experts recommend jettisoning stocks entirely during a recession
For the portion of an investor 's portfolio that stays in stocks professionals have a number of suggestions
Mr. Katz advocates issues with low price-earnings ratios that is low prices in relation to the company 's earnings per share
Low P-E stocks he says vastly outperform others during a recession or bear market
In good times he says they lag a bit but overall they provide superior performance
Prof. Arbel urges investors to discard stocks in small companies
Small-company shares typically fall more than big-company stocks in a recession he says
And in any case he argues stocks of small companies are almost as overpriced as they were Sept. 30 1987 just before the crash
For example Mr. Arbel says stocks of small companies are selling for about 19 times cash flow
Cash flow basically earnings plus depreciation is one common gauge of a company 's financial health
That ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of 19.7 that prevailed before the 1987 stock-market crash Mr. Arbel says
And it 's way above the ratio 7.5 times cash flow that bigger companies are selling for
Another major trick in making a portfolio recession-resistant is choosing stocks in defensive industries
Food tobacco drugs and utilities are the classic examples
Recession or not people still eat smoke and take medicine when they 're sick
George Putnam III editor of Turnaround Letter in Boston offers one final tip for recession-wary investors
Keep some money available for opportunities he says
If the recession does hit there will be some great investment opportunities just when things seem the blackest
Mr. Dorfman covers investing issues from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau
Some industry groups consistently weather the storm better than others
The following shows the number of times these industries outperformed the Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index during the first six months of the past seven recessions
Bond prices posted strong gains as investors went on a bargain hunt
But while the overall market improved the new-issue junk-bond market continued to count casualties even as junk-bond prices rose
Yesterday Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said it postponed a 220 million senior subordinated debenture offering by York International Corp
And Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. scrambled to restructure and improve the potential returns on a 475 million debenture offering by Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. that was still being negotiated late last night
The issue by Chicago & North Western is one of the so-called good junk-bond offerings on the new-issue calendar
Some analysts said the restructuring of the railroad concern 's issue shows how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk
Since last week 's junk-bond market debacle many new issues of high-yield high-risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back delayed or dropped
On Wednesday Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had to slash the size of Continental Airlines ' junk-bond offering to 71 million from 150 million
Salomon Brothers Inc. has delayed Grand Union Co. 's 1.16 billion junk-bond offering while it restructures the transaction
Last week the Grand Union offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow bondholders to acquire common stock
Prudential-Bache said the York issue was delayed because of market conditions
Everything is going through firehoops right now and Chicago & North Western is no exception said Mariel Clemensen vice president high-yield research at Citicorp
Portfolio managers say sweeteners like equity kickers and stricter protective covenants may increasingly be required to sell junk-bond deals
Dan Baldwin managing director of high-yield investments at Chancellor Capital Management said the Chicago & North Western offering was restructured in part because several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package
If you 're going to take the risk in this market you want something extra
Mr. Baldwin likes the offering
But several mutual-fund managers nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk-bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues said they 're staying away from any junk security that is n't considered first rate for its class
While they consider the Chicago & North Western issue to be good they do n't view it as the best
To lure buyers to the Chicago & North Western bonds portfolio managers said Donaldson Lufkin sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a 10 % equity kicker
The bonds are expected to have a 14 1\/2 % coupon rate
The equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of 10 % of the stock of CNW Corp. Chicago & North Western 's parent company
Donaldson Lufkin declined to comment on the restructuring
According to some analysts familiar with the negotiations the 10 % of equity would come directly from Donaldson Lufkin and a fund affiliated with the investment bank Blackstone Group which would reduce their CNW equity holdings by 5 % each
That would leave the Blackstone fund with a 60 % stake and Donaldson Lufkin with 15 %
Despite the problems with new issues high-yield bonds showed gains in the secondary or resell market
Junk bonds ended about one-half point higher with so-called high-quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership rising one point
In the Treasury market the benchmark 30-year bond rose seven-eighths point or 8.75 for each 1,000 face amount
The gain reflects fresh economic evidence that inflation is moderating while the economy slows
That raised hopes that interest rates will continue to move lower
The Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose just 0.2 % last month slightly lower than some economists had expected
But there were also rumors yesterday that several Japanese institutional investors were shifting their portfolios and buying long-term bonds while selling shorter-term Treasurys
Short-term Treasury securities ended narrowly mixed with two-year notes posting slight declines while three-year notes were slightly higher
Yesterday the Fed executed four-day matched sales a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system
The move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the Fed does n't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the 8 3\/4 % at which it has been hovering around during the past week
The closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans
It is considered an early signal of Fed credit policy changes
The fact that they did four-day matched sales means they are not in a mood to ease aggressively
They are telling us that 8 3\/4 % is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate said Robert Chandross at Lloyds Bank PLC
Treasury Securities The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 101 25\/32 to yield 7.955 % compared with 100 29\/32 to yield 8.032 % Wednesday
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 9\/32 to yield 7.937 % compared with 99 26\/32 to yield 8.007 %
Short-term rates rose yesterday
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.56 % from 7.51 % Wednesday while the rate on six-month bills rose to 7.57 % from 7.53 %
Meanwhile the Treasury sold 9.75 billion of 52-week bills yesterday
The average yield on the bills was 7.35 % down from 7.61 % at the previous 52-week bill auction Sept. 21
Yesterday 's yield was the lowest since 7.22 % on July 27
Here are details of the auction Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value
Thus higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it
The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year
Corporate Issues Junk bond price climbed yesterday despite skittishness in the new-issue market for high-yield securities
Dealers said junk bond issues on average were up by 1\/4 to 1\/2 point with so-called quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership posting one-point gains
Petrolane Gas Service 's 13 1\/4 % debentures traded at 102 after trading around par earlier this week and RJR 's 13 1\/2 % subordinated debentures of 2001 were at 101 5\/8 after trading at below par earlier this week
Investment-grade bonds were unchanged
Municipals Activity was brisk in the high-grade general obligation market as a series of sell lists hit the Street and capped upward price movement in the sector
Traders estimated that more than 140 million of high-grade bonds was put up for sale via bid-wanted lists circulated by a handful of major brokers
There was speculation that the supply was coming from a commercial bank 's portfolios
According to market participants the bonds were met with decent bids but the volume of paper left high grades in the 10-year and under maturity range unchanged to 0.05 percentage point higher in yield
Away from the general obligation sector activity was modest
Long dollar bonds were flat to up 3\/8 point
New Jersey Turnpike Authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 was up 3\/8 at 98 3\/8 bid to yield about 7.32 % down 0.03 percentage point
The debt of some California issuers pulled off lows reached after Tuesday 's massive earthquake although traders said market participants remained cautious
California expects to rely on federal emergency funds and its 1.06 billion in general fund reserves to meet the estimated 500 million to 1 billion in damages resulting from the quake according to a state official
It 's also unclear precisely how the state will rebuild its reserve said Cindy Katz assistant director of California 's department of finance although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose is n't anticipated
Meanwhile new issuance was slow
The largest sale in the competitive arena was a 55.7 million issue of school financing bonds from the Virginia Public School Authority
A balance of 25.8 million remained in late order-taking according to the lead manager
Mortgage-Backed Securities Mortgage securities generally ended 6\/32 to 9\/32 point higher but lagged gains in the Treasury market because of a shift in the shape of the Treasury yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts
Premium Government National Mortgage Association securities with coupon rates of 13 % and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by Congress to speed the refinancing of government-subsidized mortgages
Ginnie Mae 13 % securities were down about 1\/4 at 109 30\/32
If the refinancing plan clears Congress there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities hurting any investor paying much above par for them
In the current-coupon sector a shift in the Treasury yield curve resulting from the better performance of long-dated issues over short-dated securities hurt major coupons because it will become more difficult to structure new derivative securities offerings
Ginnie Mae 9 % securities ended at 98 6\/32 up 9\/32 and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 % securities were at 97 10\/32 up 6\/32
The Ginnie Mae 9 % issue was yielding 9.42 % to a 12-year average life assumption as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note widened 0.03 percentage point to 1.48
While Remic issuance may slow in the coming days because of the shift in the Treasury yield curve underwriters continued to crank out new real estate mortgage investment conduits structured when the yield curve was more favorable
Two new Remics totaling 900 million were announced by Freddie Mac yesterday
Foreign Bonds British government bonds ended little changed as investors awaited an economic policy address last night by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
The Treasury 11 3\/4 % bond due 2003\/2007 was down 2\/32 at 111 29\/32 to yield 10.09 % while the 11 3\/4 % notes due 1991 were unchanged at 98 19\/32 to yield 12.94 %
In Japan the bellwether No. 111 4.6 % bond of 1998 ended off 0.03 at 95.72 to yield 5.32 % and in West Germany the 7 % benchmark issue due October 1999 ended 0.05 point lower at 99.85 to yield 7.02 %
THE PANHANDLER approaches makes his pitch
It may be straightforward he wants money for food or incredibly convoluted his sister is at this very moment near death in Hoboken he has lost his wallet and has only 1.22 in change to put toward a bus ticket costing 3.83 and wo n't you give him the difference No Well how about a loan he 'll take your name and address Figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of Night Train Express most people have little trouble saying no to propositions like this
But healthy skepticism vanishes when they are solicited by an organized charity to help fight cancer famine child abuse or what have you
Most see little reason to doubt that their cash will go toward these noble goals
But will it In a distressing number of cases no
In fact the donors sometimes might be better off giving the money to the panhandler at least he has no overhead and he might even be telling the truth
Last year more than 100 billion was donated to the nation 's 400,000 charities
While the vast bulk of it was indeed spent by reputable organizations on the good works it was raised for it 's equally true that a sizable hunk was consumed in expenses claimed by other operators including fraudulent expenses
In many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a dribble of cash was left for the purported beneficiaries
It 's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity intake is devoured by stratospheric fund-raising costs high-living operators and downright fraud
But the problem clearly is widespread and persistent
State law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams and reports from watchdog groups such as the Council of Better Business Bureaus are not encouraging
The Philanthropic Advisory Service of the BBB reviews hundreds of new charities every year measuring them against minimum standards for accountability for accuracy and honesty in solicitation and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was supposedly established
The Service figures at least half of the money taken in should be spent on program
Roughly a third of the charities reviewed flunk the test
Which it should be added does n't prevent the charities from raking in a lot of money anyway
Without a microscope and a subpoena it 's often hard to sort out worthwhile causes from ripoffs if all you 've got to go on is the solicitation itself
On this basis there 's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one says David Ormstedt an assistant attorney general in Connecticut
A lot of donors just get taken
Including those he contends who put about 1 million into the kitty for the Connecticut Association of Concerned Veterans and the Vietnam Veterans Service Center
The state has sued these charities in state court complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent 82 % says Mr. Ormstedt went to fund raisers and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their relatives for fur coats trips to Florida Lucullan restaurant tabs
The telephone number for the charity in Shelton Conn. has been disconnected and the former officials could n't be located
Running a charity does cost money but reputable organizations manage to get the lion 's share of donations out to where they are really needed
The Arthritis Foundation the American Cancer Society and the United Way of America all say that they spend roughly 90 % of their income on programs not overhead
With some other charities however it s the other way around
The fledgling National Children 's Cancer Society for example took in 2.5 million last year to finance bone-marrow transplants for children
By the time it paid its expenses it only had 120,000 left not enough to treat even one child
The state of Illinois is suing the charity for fraud in Chicago along with Telesystems Marketing Inc. its Houston-based fund raiser
Both deny wrongdoing
The charity admits spending a lot on fund raising but says that was necessary to establish a donor base it can tap at much lower cost in years to come
Michael Burns president of Telesystems says his concern has only benefited from the publicity surrounding the case noting that three other charities have signed on as clients because they were impressed with the amount he raised for National Children 's
Meanwhile a state court judge has allowed the charity to go on soliciting funds
Enforcers ca n't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion 's share of their income on fund raising
State laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income usually half that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead but these have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court
It has ruled that such laws might work to stifle fund raising which would amount to limiting the charities ' first-amendment right to freedom of expression
This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently
The attorney general 's office in Connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere
In making cases the authorities frequently zero in on alleged misrepresentations made by the charities ' fund raisers
Illinois for instance currently has under investigation 10 of the 30 companies drumming up funds for charities soliciting there
Enforcers pay special attention to operators using sweepstakes prizes as an additional inducement to give
Attorneys general in several states including Illinois are already suing Watson & Hughey Co. an Alexandria Va.-based outfit that they say has used deceptive sweepstakes ads to solicit donations for the American Heart Disease Foundation and the Cancer Fund of America
According to the Illinois attorney general 's suit Watson & Hughey sent mailings indicating that recipients were guaranteed cash prizes and could win up to an additional 1,000 on top of them if they contributed as little as 7
But the total value of the prizes was only 5,000 and most winners will receive just 10 cents according to the attorney general 's office
The suit is still pending in Illinois state court
Watson & Hughey has denied the allegations in court officials decline to comment further
While they can target some of the most obvious miscreants enforcers concede that they are only scratching the surface
There are so many cunning ploys used by so many dubious operators they say that it is probably impossible to stop them all
One maneuver the public education gambit
The solicitation material indicates that donations will go toward a campaign alerting and informing the public about some health or other issue
What it does n't say is that the entire campaign may be the fund-raising letter itself
All too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as Do n't smoke or Wear suntan lotion ' says William Webster attorney general of Missouri
By putting these pithy statements on the solicitations hundreds of thousands of dollars are claimed to have been spent on education to consumers when in fact this represents the costs of sending the newsletters
Mr. Webster cites a four-page mailing from the United Cancer Council that offers a chance to win 5,000 in gold bullion to those giving as little as 5 to cancer education
A few boilerplate warnings about cancer appear but that 's only two inches in all four pages
I think some people may believe they 're helping fund a massive TV and print campaign but we could n't find that the charity does anything except write these letters he says
Officials at the Washington D.C.-based charity did n't return repeated phone calls
Many fly-by-night charities ride the coattails of the biggest best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs
The established charities are bothered by this but say they can do little about it
We ca n't police the many organizations that have sprung up in the last few years using part of our name
Most of them do n't last for long but in the meantime all we can do is tell people they are n't connected with us says a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association
And sometimes a reputable charity with a household name gets used and does n't even know it
A couple in Rockford Ill. raised 12,591 earlier this year using the name and logo of Mothers Against Drunk Driving without permission from the group
MADD did n't learn of the fund raising until the couple sent it a check for 613 along with a letter saying that was the charity 's share
The Illinois Attorney General won a court order to prevent the couple from raising further funds without MADD 's permission
The couple could n't be reached for comment and apparently have left Rockford law enforcement officials report
Denise McDonald a spokeswoman for MADD says It 's scary because anybody could do this

Overhead costs at some of the largest charities in millions of dollars British Airways PLC a crucial participant in the proposed buy-out of UAL Corp. washed its hands of the current efforts to revive a bid for the parent of United Airlines
Specifically the British carrier said it currently has no plans to participate in any new offer for UAL
In addition British Air officially withdrew its support for the previous 300-a-share bid in a terse statement that said the original deal is closed
Company officials said later that British Airways believes its involvement in the UAL buy-out ended last Friday when the buy-out group which also includes UAL 's management and pilot union failed to obtain financing for the 6.79 billion transaction
The carrier stopped short of saying it would n't at some point reconsider participating in any new bid for UAL
However company officials said they plan to take no initiatives to resurrect the transaction and are n't aware of any restructured bid in the making
Collectively the statements raised questions about whether a new bid for UAL will ever get off the ground
The transaction has had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known last Friday with no signs or statements from the buy-out group to indicate that any progress has taken place
However in response to the British Air decision United 's pilot union vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy-out
Pilot union Chairman Frederick C. Dubinsky said advisers to UAL management and the union will begin meeting in New York today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal to present to UAL 's board at the earliest time possible
Pilot union advisers appeared confident that a new bid could go forward even without British Air 's participation
UAL declined to comment on British Air 's statement
UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf who is leading the management end of the buy-out has n't provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal
In another setback yesterday United 's machinist union asked the Treasury Department to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy-out proposal violated tax laws
In an effort to derail the buy-out the union has already called for investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission Transportation Department and Labor Department
But there was one bright spot yesterday
The United flight-attendants union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake
The pilot union the only one to support the buy-out thus far said the flight attendants ' decision enforces our belief that an all-employee owned airline is practical and achievable
Still without the assurance of British Airways ' financial backing it will be tougher for the buy-out group to convince already-reluctant banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid especially since British Air 's original investment represented 78 % of the cash equity contribution for the bid
Under the previous plan British Air would have received a 15 % stake in UAL in exchange for a 750 million equity investment with a 75 % stake going to UAL employees and 10 % to UAL management
British Air officials said the airline 's chairman Lord King was concerned about news reports indicating that British Air might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the British carrier
The previous reports were based on remarks by British Air 's chief financial officer Derek Stevens who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in UAL 's stock in the past week
UAL stock dropped 1.625 yesterday to 190.125 on volume of 923,500 shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
UAL declined to comment on British Air 's statement
In an interview Wednesday with Dow Jones Professional Investor Report Mr. Stevens said We 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all
We 're not rushing into anything
We do n't want to be party to a second rejection
Indeed British Air seemed to be distancing itself from the troubled transaction early in an effort to avoid any further embarrassment
The original transaction fell through on the same day British Air shareholders approved the plan at a special meeting after the British succeeded in arranging the financing for its equity contribution
The carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its American counterparts
The buy-out consortium ceased to exist because our American partners were not capable of organizing the financing a British Air spokesman said
British Airways may have begun to have second thoughts about the transaction after the Transportation Department forced Northwest 's Airlines ' new owners to restructure the equity contribution of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in that carrier
Most of the department 's statements since the Northwest transaction indicated it planned to curtail foreign ownership stakes in U.S. carriers
Even before British Air 's announcement pilot union leaders had been meeting in Chicago yesterday to consider their options
The leaders expressed support for trying to revive the bid following a briefing Wednesday by the union 's advisers Lazard Freres & Co. and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison
They also unanimously re-elected Mr. Dubinsky the union chairman who has led the pilots ' 2 1\/2-year fight to take control of the airline
UAL 's advisers have indicated previously that it may take a while to come forward with a revised plan since they want to have firm bank commitments before launching a new bid
They have maintained that banks remain interested in financing the transaction
The buy-out fell through after Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. the lead banks in the transaction failed to obtain 7.2 billion in financing needed for the plan
Italy 's industrial wholesale sales index rose 13.2 % in June from a year earlier the state statistical institute Istat said
The June increase compared with a rise of 10.5 % in May from a year earlier
Domestic wholesale sales rose 11.9 % from a year earlier while foreign sales jumped 17.3 % Istat said
For the first six months wholesale sales rose 12.3 % from the year before reflecting to a 11.5 % jump in domestic sales and a 14.6 % boost in foreign sales
Sales of capital goods to foreign and domestic destinations increased 16.6 % in the January-June period from a year earlier
Sales of consumer goods rose 6.9 % in the same period while sales of intermediate goods were up 13.8 % from a year ago
Senate Democrats favoring a cut in the capital-gains tax have decided under pressure from their leaders not to offer their own proposal placing another obstacle in the path of President Bush 's legislative priority
A core group of six or so Democratic senators has been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets
The plan was complete except for finishing touches and there was talk that it would be unveiled as early as yesterday
But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell D. Maine a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut called the group to meet with him Wednesday night and again yesterday
Sen. Mitchell urged them to desist
Afterward leaders of the dissident Democrats relented and said they would n't offer their own proposal as they had planned
The decision is a setback for President Bush who needs the support of Democrats to pass the tax cut through the Democratic-controlled Senate
Having a proposal sponsored by Democrats would have given the president an advantage
Having only a Republican measure makes the task harder
Still Sen. Bob Packwood R. Ore. the lead sponsor of the Republican capital-gains amendment predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year
He said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to overcome any procedural hurdle the Democratic leadership might erect
But Sen. Mitchell buoyed by his victory among fellow Democrats strongly disagreed
Mr. Mitchell has been predicting that the president 's initiative would fail this year
Yesterday in an interview he added that the Democrats ' decision increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year
Mr. Mitchell 's first victory came last week when the Senate passed a deficit-reduction bill that did n't contain a capital-gains provision
That vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill now being drafted by House and Senate negotiators
The House version of the bill does include the tax cut
Now Republican leaders are concentrating on attaching a capital-gains amendment to some other bill perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit-reduction legislation
To help lay the groundwork for that fight President Bush plans early next week to meet at the White House with some 20 Democratic senators who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are undecided on the issue
The president apparently will have only one bill to push Sen. Packwood 's and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it
I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor said Sen. David Boren D. Okla. a leader of those Democrats
The Packwood plan as expected would allow individuals to exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year
The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of 35 % after seven years
The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1
As an alternative taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index
For corporations the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 % from the current top rate of 34 %
That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years
The Packwood plan also would include a proposal designed by Sen. William Roth R. Del. that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts
The Roth plan would create a new non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement but also for the purchase of a first home education expenses and medical expenses
Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs but would be subject to tax though no penalty
Westmoreland Coal Co. realizing benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity reported sharply improved third-quarter results
The producer and marketer of low-sulfur coal said net income for the quarter was 5.9 million or 71 cents a share on revenue of 145.4 million
For the year-earlier period the company reported a loss of 520,000 or six cents a share
In the latest nine months the company earned 8.5 million or 1.03 a share
Last year 's net loss of 3,524,000 included a benefit of 1,640,000 from an accounting change
Revenue for the nine months rose to 449 million from 441.1 million
In an interview Pemberton Hutchinson president and chief executive cited several reasons for the improvement higher employee productivity and good natural conditions in the mines as well as lower costs for materials administrative overhead and debt interest
In the latest nine months Mr. Hutchinson said total coal sales rose to about 14.6 million tons from about 14.3 million tons a year earlier
In addition long-term debt has been trimmed to about 72 million from 96 million since Jan. 1
He predicted the debt ratio will improve further in coming quarters
Westmoreland 's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling low-sulphur coal in the Appalachia region
The operating territory includes coal terminals on the Ohio River and in Newport News Va
Westmoreland exports about a fourth of its coal tonnage including a significant amount of metallurgical coal produced by others that is used by steelmakers overseas
For the past couple of years Westmoreland has undertaken an aggressive streamlining of all aspects of its business
Marginal operations and assets have been sold
The size of the company 's board has been reduced to eight directors from 13
About 140 salaried management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage positions have been eliminated
Even perks have been reduced
For example the chief executive himself now pays 20 % of the cost of his health benefits the company used to pay 100 %
I think the ship is now righted the bilges are pumped and we are on course Mr. Hutchinson said of the restructuring program
Much of what we set out to do is completed
But he cautioned that Westmoreland 's third quarter is typically better than the fourth so investors should n't just multiply the third quarter by four and assume the same rate of improvement can be sustained
One difference he said is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer workdays because of holidays and the hunting season
I do n't want to give the impression that everybody can relax now he said
We have to keep working at improving our core business to stay efficient
It 's a process that never really ends
Nevertheless Mr. Hutchinson predicted that 1989 would be solidly profitable for Westmoreland and that 1990 would bring more of the same
For all of 1988 the company reported an after-tax operating loss of 134,000 on revenue of 593.5 million
An accounting adjustment made net income 1.5 million or 18 cents a share
In a move that complements the company 's basic strategy its Westmoreland Energy Inc. unit is developing four coal-fired cogeneration plants with a partner in Virginia
Some of the coal the plants buy will come from Westmoreland mines
Mr. Hutchinson predicted that the unit 's contribution to company results in the 1990s will be exciting
He said Westmoreland is looking at investment stakes in other cogeneration plants east of the Mississippi River
Westmoreland expects energy demand to grow annually in the 2.5 % range in the early 1990s
We see coal 's piece of the action growing Mr. Hutchinson said
Coal prices while not skyrocketing will grow modestly in real terms we think
Chase Manhattan Corp. after trying unsuccessfully to sell its interest in its lower Manhattan operations building has exercised its option to purchase the 50-story office tower
Chase had purchased an option to buy the building at One New York Plaza for an undisclosed sum from the late Sol Atlas as part of its original lease in 1970
The current transaction cost the bank approximately 140 million
Of that amount 20 million was payment for the land underneath the building and the rest was for the building itself
The building houses about 4,500 Chase workers most of whom will be moved to downtown Brooklyn after the bank 's new back office center is completed in 1993
The move is part of Chase 's strategy to consolidate its back offices under one roof
The headquarters is located a few blocks away at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza
As part of its decision to leave the building Chase tried to sell its interest along with the Atlas estate 's interest shortly after the October 1987 stock market crash
Chase Senior Vice President George Scandalios said the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations
He said Chase and the Atlas estate were looking to sell the entire building for 400 million to 475 million but did n't get an offer for more than 375 million
As the building 's new owner Chase will have its work cut out for it
Chase is vacating 1.1 million square feet of space and Salomon Brothers Inc. whose headquarters is in the building also plans to move shortly
In addition another major building tenant Thomson McKinnon Inc. 's Thomson McKinnon Securities likely will vacate the premises as part of its liquidation
New York real estate brokerage Edward S. Gordon Co. will have the difficult task of finding new tenants
Even with its striking views of the New York harbor the building is considered antiquated by modern office standards
And Chase will have to spend approximately 50 million to remove asbestos from the premises
WALL STREET SHAKE hands with George Orwell
The author of the futuristic novel 1984 invented a language called Newspeak that made it impossible to fully develop a heretical thought that is anything negative about the policies and practices of the state
Wall Street has n't gotten that far yet but it has made a promising start
Its language call it Streetspeak is increasingly mellifluous reassuring and designed to make financial products and maneuvers appear better safer or cheaper than they really are
When something undeniably nasty happens a few euphemisms are deployed to simply make it disappear much as a fresh grave may be covered by a blanket of flowers
For example we 'll bet you thought that the stock market crashed two years ago
Wrong
According to some of the grand panjandrums of the market it never happened
In their lexicon the 508-point collapse in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 19 1987 was just a big blip
Trotting out a much-beloved Streetspeak term New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan recently declared that history would record the event as only a major technical correction
Another much-beloved saying however this one in plain English holds that if something walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it is a duck
On Oct. 29 1929 a date historians stubbornly insist on associating with the dreaded C-word the DJ industrials fell 12.8 %
In the technical correction of two years ago they lost a whopping 22.6 %
Customers hear a lot of this stuff from people who try to sell them stock
These people used to be called brokers but apparently this word either is not grandiose enough or carries too many negative connotations from the aforementioned technical correction when terrified customers could n't raise brokers on the phone
Either way the word broker is clearly out of favor
Of the major New York-based securities firms only Morgan Stanley & Co. still calls its salespeople brokers
At Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. they are financial consultants
At Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Prudential Bache Securities and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. they are account executives
At PaineWebber Inc. they are investment executives
Such titles are designed to convey a sense of dignified broad-scale competence and expertise in selling today 's myriad financial products
It is a competence and expertise that some brokers themselves overwhelmed by all the new things being dreamed up for them to peddle do n't feel
It s almost product de jour grouses one account executive at Dean Witter
The transmogrified brokers never let the C-word cross their lips instead stressing such terms as safe insured and guaranteed even though these terms may be severely limited in their application to a particular new financial product
The names of some of these products do n't suggest the risk involved in buying them either
A case in point government-plus bond funds
What could imply more safety than investing in government bonds What could be better than getting a tad more income from them the plus than other people Indeed conservative investors many of them elderly have poured more than 50 billion into such funds which promise fatter yields than ordinary Treasury bonds only to learn later that these funds use part of their money to dabble in high-risk bond options a gambler 's game
When a certain class of investment performs so poorly that its reputation is tarnished look for Wall Street to give it a new moniker
This seems to be happening now to limited partnerships many of which either have gone into the tank in recent years or have otherwise been grievous disappointments
They are still being sold but more and more often as direct investments with all the same risks they had under the old label
In such cases the game has n't changed only the name
In others a familiar old name still prevails but the underlying game has changed
For example no load mutual funds remain a favorite with investors because they do n't carry a frontend sales commission
Getting out of them however may be a different story now
Traditional no-loads made their money by charging an annual management fee usually a modest one they imposed no other fees and many still do n't
In recent years though a passel of others flying the no-load flag have been imposing hefty charges all the way up to 6 % when an investor sells his shares
Should n't they properly be called exit-load funds The mutual-fund industry is debating the question but do n't expect a new name while the old one is working so well
And do n't expect anyone to change the term blue chip either even though some of the companies that still enjoy the title may be riskier investments than they were
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. for one is still a favorite of widows orphans and trust departments but shorn of its regional telephone units and exposed to competition on every side it is a far different investment prospect than it was before divestiture
Also blue chips in general have suffered much more short-term price volatility in recent years
Larry Biehl a money manager in San Mateo Calif. blames that on the advent of program trading in which computers used by big institutional investors are programmed to buy and sell big blocks when certain market conditions prevail
Blue chips he says are now being referred to as poker chips
Finally even the time-honored strategy called value investing no longer means what it once did
Before the takeover mania of the '80s it referred to rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks especially those with shrewd management sound fundamentals and decent prospects
Now says Mr. Biehl value investing often means looking for downtrodden companies with terrible management that are in real trouble
To institutional investors or brokers he adds a company with value is a company at risk of being swallowed up

I was amused to read your recent news stories on the banking industry 's reserve additions and concomitant threats to cease making new loans to less-developed countries
If the whole story were told it would read something like this During the 1970s the commercial banks lured the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and Use of Proceeds confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made
The reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings and management bonuses the price a sea of bad loans
For the past several years the banks lacking a private navy to enforce their interests have been pressuring the U.S. Treasury to underwrite their bad LDC credits
The Treasury wisely has refused but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational agencies should be made available for a price either debt reduction or debt-service reduction or new loans the Brady Plan
The banks will threaten not to make further loans but in truth lacking the capital to write off their mistakes or to build a navy they have no alternative but to go along
George A. Wiegers Gillette Co. elected Warren E. Buffett chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to its board increasing the number of directors to 12 from 11
Berkshire Hathaway earlier this year bought 600 million of preferred stock in Gillette that is convertible into an 11 % stake and Gillette said at the time that Mr. Buffett would be added to the board
Separately Gillette said its third-quarter earnings rose 2 % to 65.2 million or 57 cents a share from 63.9 million or 57 cents a share in the year-earlier period per-share earnings remained flat despite an increase in net income in part because the company paid a 10.4 million dividend on the new preferred stock in the period
Sales rose 9 % to 921.6 million from 845.7 million with sales of the company 's international\/diversified operations well above the year earlier-period
For the nine months Gillette 's net income declined 1 % to 205.3 million or 2.02 a share from 207 million or 1.82 a share in the 1988 period
Sales rose 6 % to 2.77 billion from 2.61 billion
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange the company closed yesterday at 45.50 a share up 25 cents
When Walter Yetnikoff the president of Sony Corp. 's CBS Records last month told producer Peter Guber that Sony was about to make a 3.4 billion bid for Columbia Pictures and needed someone to run the studio Mr. Guber jumped at the chance
Within two days he was on his way to New York and Tokyo to meet with top brass at Sony
And before the week was out Sony had offered Mr. Guber and his partner Jon Peters the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business
Not only that Sony also agreed to give them a stake in Columbia 's future profits and buy their company Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for 200 million almost 40 % more than the market value of the company
There was just one sticking point The two had a prior commitment
Just seven months earlier they had signed a five-year exclusive contract to make movies for Warner Bros. for which they had just produced the smash hit Batman
But Mr. Guber figured that Warner Communications Inc. chairman Steven Ross would empathize and let the producers go knowing the Sony offer was the culmination of a life 's work
He figured wrong
Last week following fruitless settlement talks Warner now merging with Time Inc. filed a 1 billion breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against both Sony and Guber Peters
Sony promptly countersued charging Warner with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the U.S. movie business
The accusations of lying and duplicity are flying thick and fast on both sides As one Sony executive puts it It 's World War III
That two successful producers who are n't all that well known outside Hollywood could occasion such a clash of corporate titans suggests how desperate the quest for proven talent is in the movie business
And they are a very odd team in any case
Mr. Guber was raised in Boston and educated in New York
He is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees
Mr. Peters is a high-school dropout who came to fame as Barbra Streisand 's hairdresser
Yet they are far and away the most prolific producers in Hollywood
And despite their share of duds they make movies that make money
That is a skill Sony badly needs and Warner is loath to lose
Although Columbia had a good summer with Ghostbusters II and When Harry Met Sally rivals such as Warner Paramount Pictures Walt Disney Co. and Universal Studios have been thrashing Columbia at the box office
After five years of management turmoil with four different studio heads Columbia sorely needs a stable savvy team to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters are n't universally loved in Hollywood but they are well connected
Their stock in trade as executive producers is sniffing out hot properties locking them up and then getting big studios to bankroll and distribute them
Sometimes Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a Flashdance or buy rights to a best seller such as The Color Purple
It falls to others to do the writing directing and producing
With MGM\/UA 's Rainman for instance Messrs. Guber and Peters had virtually nothing to do with day-to-day production but their names still appear in big letters on the credits and they are inevitably associated with its success
Sometimes as with Batman the pair really do make the film
In that case Guber Peters acquired the rights in 1979 nursed the movie through a dozen scripts and were on the set in London for 11 months hovering over the most minute changes in casting and production
They 're the best production talent around says Brian De Palma beholden to Guber Peters for hiring him to direct the Warner movie of Tom Wolfe 's novel Bonfire of the Vanities
On that film which is to start shooting in a few months they 've been very much involved hiring talent and discussing the development of the script
And when you 're making a movie this big you need all the help you can get Mr. De Palma adds
I wish they were around 24 hours a day
And some movies seem to have been hurt by their inattention
Warner executives blame Mr. Guber 's and Mr. Peters 's lack of involvement in Caddyshack II for casting and production problems and the film 's ultimate dismal failure
We 've had a few bombs admits Mr. Peters
But by and large this company has only been profitable
He says his company 's prowess at packaging and marketing is why we 'll be good at Columbia
We practically ran our own studio
Longtime Hollywood associates describe Mr. Guber as the intellectual powerhouse of the two a man with a flair for deal-making and marketing
Peter is a major piece of Hollywood manpower who has really earned his success says Robert Bookman an agent at Creative Artists Agency
Mark Johnson the producer of Rainman chimes in He has a great ability to hire terrific people and delegate authority
It 's no accident that they 've been able to develop such successful material
Mr. Peters on the other hand has fewer fans in Hollywood and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot-tempered bully
He gets better reviews as a creative whiz an enthusiast an idea man
He also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did
Barbra Streisand made him famous
He cut her hair
He lived with her
He came to produce her records and her movies A Star Is Born and The Main Event
Thrice married but now single Mr. Peters got plenty of ink last summer for an on-set romance with actress Kim Basinger during the making of Batman
Mr. Guber by contrast has been married to one woman for more than 20 years
But for all their intellectual and stylistic differences they make the perfect good cop bad cop team Hollywood associates say
Peter is the bright sympathetic guy when you 're doing a deal says one agent
If there 's a problem Peter disappears and all of a sudden Jon shows up
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters rub many people in Hollywood the wrong way
Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer who shepherded Flashdance through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie bristle when Messrs. Guber and Peters take credit for the film
Says Mr. Simpson The script was unreadable
We reinvented it
We are the producers of that movie
They got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit as executive producers
When Roger Birnbaum an executive who worked for Guber Peters in the early 1980s left to take a job as head of production at the United Artists studio they made him forfeit all credits and financial interest in the films he had helped develop including Rainman and Batman
Mr. Peters acknowledges that and says it 's not unlike the situation he and Mr. Guber are in with Warner
I was upset with Roger I fumpered and schmumpered says Mr. Peters
But he wanted to pursue his own dream and he went
Still Mr. Birnbaum says his relationship with Guber Peters was one of the most successful I 've had in Hollywood
The two have a wonderful chemistry Jon is very impulsive and Peter is very compulsive adds Mr. Birnbaum who is now head of production at News Corp. 's 20th Century Fox Film Co
Jon Peters will come barreling into a room say he 's got a great idea and be gone
Peter will take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific
Mr. Birnbaum recalls that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered naturalist Dian Fossey which became Gorillas in the Mist
He says Within a few weeks we made deals with the government of Rwanda and everyone who had ever met or talked to Dian Fossey
I think Peter even made some deals with the gorillas
Universal Studios was working on a competing film but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed to co-produce the film with Guber Peters and Warner
More recently Guber Peters beat out a dozen other producers reportedly including Robert Redford and Ted Turner for rights to the life story of Chico Mendes the murdered Brazilian union leader who fought developers in the Amazon rain forest
Messrs. Guber and Peters assiduously courted the man 's widow for months showing her a tape of Gorillas in the Mist to impress her with the quality of their work
Money helped too
Ultimately they paid more than 1 million for the rights
The sale caused a rift between the widow and some of her husband 's followers
Some of the money will go to the Chico Mendes Foundation but it is n't earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest
It 's hardly astonishing given the men 's track record that Sony wants Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters
But it is puzzling to some Hollywood executives that Sony rushed to hire them without clearing up the Warner situation first
Some note that Sony might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring Mr. Guber and letting Mr. Peters stay on to fulfill the Warner contract
But though people in town may ask why Guber needs Peters it 's good to have a partner and obviously the chemistry works says Steven Tisch a producer who once worked for Mr. Guber
This business is n't about personalities at the end of the day it s about whether the ink is red or black
In the case of Peter and Jon the ink has been very very black
Mr. Guber got his start in the movie business at Columbia two decades ago
Recruited from New York University 's MBA program he rose within two years to head of production overseeing such films as The Way We Were Taxi Driver Tommy and Shampoo
In 1976 he teamed up with record producer Neil Bogart in Casablanca Records and Filmworks later called Polygram Pictures where they produced such hits as as The Deep and Midnight Express
In 1980 Mr. Guber got together with Mr. Peters by then a successful producer in his own right after the death of Mr. Bogart
While Guber Peters produced a number of hits for Warner and others their record was n't always so impressive
Among their clinkers were The Legend of Billie Jean VisionQuest Clue and Clan of the Cave Bear
And the failures make it possible for Warner in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates
The studio says it stuck with them even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for Warner
Mr. Guber replies that this is a Goliath this Time Warner trying to chew up two fellows who have done only well for them for a long period of time
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters maintain that executives at Warner have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse but that Warner never felt threatened until they linked up with Sony
From the beginning they knew we had a goal and a dream says Mr. Guber
On a number of occasions he adds he tried to get Warner to buy Guber Peters outright
They always listened but they never acted Mr. Guber says
In 1987 Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters contributed their company 's assets in exchange for a 28 % stake in Barris Entertainment a small-fry TV production company controlled by Giant Industries Inc. Chairman Burt Sugarman
In July a year later Warner agreed to release the producers from their old contract when Messrs. Guber Peters and Sugarman made a 100 million offer to buy 25 % of MGM\/UA
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters planned to run the nearly dormant MGM studio and the two even tried to interest Warner Bros
President Terry Semel in becoming a partner after he advised them on the deal
But the MGM plan collapsed just two weeks later
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say they got a look at the books and balked at the price
Their relationship with Mr. Sugarman soured shortly thereafter
Last May he sold his 24 % stake in Barris to a passive Australian investor and Barris was renamed Guber Peters Entertainment Co
Meanwhile Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters had agreed to extend their Warner agreement with the new five-year exclusive contract
The new deal was considered the most generous of its kind both financially and in terms of creative freedom
But it paled by comparison to what Sony was to offer last month the chance at last to run a major studio about 50 million in deferred compensation up to 10 % of Columbia 's future cash flow 8 % of the future appreciation of Columbia 's market value and annual salaries of 2.7 million for each
The producers ' 28 % share of publicly held Guber Peters would net them an additional 50 million
Sony also agreed to indemnify the producers against any liability to Warner
Sony is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only 42 million last year
And earnings have been erratic
In the the latest quarter thanks in part to Batman Guber Peters earned 5.8 million or 50 cents a share compared to a loss of 6.8 million or 62 cents a share in last year 's quarter
Guber Peters stock which traded as low as 6 a share last year closed yesterday at 16.625
The two sides now are accusing each other of lying
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters claim they have an oral agreement with Warner executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise
But in affidavits filed yesterday in the Los Angeles court Mr. Ross Warner Bros. Chairman Robert Daly and President Semel deny that such an oral agreement was ever made
Warner in its court filings calls it a piece of fiction created for this litigation
Mr. Daly in his affidavit acknowledges that Warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over MGM but says that situation was altogether different
For one thing according to Mr. Daly the producers requested a release in advance
Moreover the old contract was about to expire and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner was n't as strong as it is now
Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights and it was in Warner 's interest to accommodate MGM\/UA Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives Mr. Daly said in his affidavit
Warner obviously does n't think that it is in its own interests to let Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters go off to Columbia
At the very least Mr. Ross clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from Sony
During settlement talks for example Warner demanded such things as cable TV rights to Columbia movies and Columbia 's interest in the studio it jointly owns with Warner according to executives involved in the talks
In any settlement Warner is almost certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters have locked up for the next few years notably sequels to Batman
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the Sony offer before taking it up with Warner
And they say there are plenty of precedents in Hollywood for letting people out of contracts
The last time Columbia Pictures was looking for a studio chief they note Warner released producer David Puttnam from his contract then took him back after he was subsequently fired by his bosses at Columbia
In his affidavit filed yesterday Warner 's Mr. Ross indicated he is n't buying any such argument If Sony succeeds here no written contract in Hollywood will be worth the paper it 's written on
THE SALES PITCH could n't sound better
First there 's the name asset-backed securities
Better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing
And there 's more
The assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest and most secure institutions
Most earn high ratings from credit agencies
Their yields are higher than those of U.S. Treasury issues
And the booming market has already attracted many of the nation 's biggest institutional investors
Ready to jump Well think twice
The concept may be simple Take a bunch of loans tie them up in one neat package and sell pieces of the package to investors
But the simplicity may be misleading
Skeptics say the slightly higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk
They warn that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them and those are hard to evaluate
Moreover the securities were introduced only about 4 1\/2 years ago the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession
A lot of this stuff really is in untested waters says Owen Carney director of the investment securities division of the U.S. comptroller of the currency
We do n't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn
Such concerns however have n't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of Wall Street 's hottest new products
Since the spring of 1985 financial alchemists have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities
They have sold issues backed by car loans boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans
They have offered bundles of homeequity loans as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares
Last year there was an issue of death-backed bonds securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders
Some predict there will be Third World bonds backed by loans to Brazil Argentina and other debt-ridden nations
And the biggest volume this year has been on securities backed by credit-card receivables sometimes known as plastic bonds
This is the heyday of debt says James Grant editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer a newsletter
Before the sun sets on the '80s it seems nothing will be left unhocked
The result is a 45 billion market according to Securities Data Co
That includes more than 9.5 billion issued through August of this year up sharply from 6.5 billion in the comparable 1988 period and more than in all of 1987
Most issues have been sold to professional money managers pension funds bank trust departments and other institutions
But wealthy individuals also have been jumping in and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market
The entry fee is affordable Issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of 1,000
We expect additional offerings of asset-backed securities targeted toward individual investors says Bill Addiss a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc
The process typically begins when an institution such as Citibank or Sears Roebuck & Co. takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust
The trust then issues securities generally due in five years or less that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors
Issues typically come with credit enhancements such as a bank letter of credit and thus have received high credit ratings
Enthusiasts say the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions
Asset-backed securities are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds says Craig J. Goldberg managing director and head of the asset-backed securities group at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
But skeptics question whether asset-backed bonds offer sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks
Consider a 500 million offering of 9 % securities issued last spring and backed by Citibank credit-card receivables
The triple-A-rated issue offered a yield of only about 0.5 percentage point above four-year Treasury issues
On a 10,000 investment that 's a difference of only 50 a year
That kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street
But for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have that margin is meaningless
If you 're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby then even an extra 25 basis points 0.25 percentage point becomes an important consideration on a career basis says Mr. Grant
But if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again then that is n't of overwhelming importance
Moreover the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level
That 's why some investment managers such as Alex Powers a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank 's private banking division do n't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax states such as New York or California
But Mr. Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts such as retirement plans
He points out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over Treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts
Another concern is liquidity or how easily a security can be converted into cash
The secondary or resale market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues
That could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature
That 's particularly true analysts say for certain of the securities such as those backed by time-share loans
You could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market says Jonathan S. Paris a vice president of European Investors Inc. a New York investment-management firm
In addition an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange can simply check newspaper listings
There are n't any such listings for asset-backed securities
Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem
Investors for instance may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities
It is n't
The front cover of the prospectus for the Citibank credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks Citibank N.A. Citicorp or any affiliate thereof
In other words if there 's a problem do n't expect Citibank to come to the rescue
The prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency
That means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received
That also is n't easy
Take the credit enhancements which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond-insurance company
The letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities
Nor does it cover the entire portfolio
Details of credit enhancements vary widely from issue to issue
Still they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues which in turn is why the yield above Treasurys is so slim
But skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper
When you buy an asset-backed issue you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties
If a bank 's credit rating was lowered because of say its loans to Third World nations that could also affect the ratings liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports
Underwriters insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions
But despite the credit enhancements despite the high ratings some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets
At a time when Americans are leveraged to their eyeballs asset-backed investors may be taking a heady gamble that consumers will be able to repay loans in hard times
At the very least a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest-quality bonds they can find that is Treasurys
That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities as well as make it tougher to unload the latter
But it could be much worse
Some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues
For one thing credit-card loans are unsecured
In addition they fear that banks have been overeager to issue cards to the public giving cards to too many big spenders who will default during a recession
A day of reckoning is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues and therefore we think the best debt investment is U.S. government bonds says Craig Corcoran of Davis\/Zweig Futures Inc. an investment advisory firm
What about triple-A-rated asset-backed issues Nope we still say to stick with Treasurys Mr. Corcoran replies
Ratings he notes are subject to change
All this makes asset-backed securities seem too risky for many people
And it reminds Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. of what he calls DeVoe 's Unprovable but Highly Probable Theory No. 1 More money has been lost reaching for yield than in all the stock speculations scams and frauds of all time
Mr. Herman is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau

IF YOU FORCE financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence it would probably be a one-word sentence Diversify
Judging by a poll of Wall Street Journal readers conducted this summer by Erdos & Morgan Inc. serious investors have taken that advice to heart
Nearly 1,000 investors responded to the Journal 's poll providing an in-depth look at their portfolios
Those portfolios are remarkably diversified
By spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one area be it stocks bonds or real estate
For example about 88 % of Journal readers owned stock down slightly from 91 % in a similar poll last year
But only 17.5 % said they had more than half their money in the stock market
Similarly 57 % of respondents own shares in a money-market mutual fund and 33 % own municipal bonds
But only 6 % to 7 % of the investors were committing more than half their funds to either of those alternatives
The poll conducted Aug. 7-28 also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics
It found them in a cautious but not downbeat mood
Of 1,500 people sent a questionnaire 951 replied
The response rate more than 63 % allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence
The results ca n't be extrapolated to all investors though
Journal readers are relatively affluent with a median household income of between 75,000 and 99,000
Nearly half of the respondents 47 % said their investment portfolio was worth 250,000 or more and 17 % said it was worth 1 million or more
The respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were a year ago
For example 12 % of this year 's respondents said they expect a recession within 12 months
Last year only 8 % were expecting a recession
An additional 56 % of this year 's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next 12 months
Only 42 % of last year 's respondents anticipated slowing growth
Apparently the respondents do n't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much
A slim majority 51 % think stock prices will be higher in August 1990 than they were in August 1989
Their verdict on real estate is almost the same
Some 50 % expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12 months
By contrast only 32 % expect an increase in the price of gold
Since gold tends to soar when inflation is high that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control
Even though only 12 % actually predicted a recession many respondents were taking a better-safe-than sorry investment stance
Nearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession
For the most part the changes were slight
The two-thirds who have n't tried to make their portfolios more recession-resistant were split about evenly between investors who do n't believe in trying to predict the markets about 31 % and investors who do n't expect a recession about 15 % or are unsure if and when a recession might come about 22 %
A buy-and-hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents
Most own two to 10 stocks and buy or sell no more than three times a year
Some 71 % had bought some stock in the past year only 57 % had sold any
But the lurking shadow of 1987 's stock-market crash still seems dark
About 33 % considered another crash likely while about 63 % said one is unlikely
Those percentages hardly changed from the previous year 's poll
And the respondents ' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual
About 60 % of them said they would ordinarily have at least 25 % of their money in stocks
But as of August only 50 % actually had stock-market investments of that size
Most stock-market indexes were hitting all-time highs at around the time of the poll
But it appears that many Journal readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious rather than a signal to jump on the bandwagon

Canadian steel ingot production totaled 276,334 metric tons in the week ended Oct. 14 down 5.3 % from the preceding week 's total of 291,890 tons Statistics Canada a federal agency said
The week 's total was down 7.1 % from 297,446 tons a year earlier
A metric ton is equal to 2,204.62 pounds

Moody 's Investors Service said it lowered its rating on about 75 million of this Chatsworth Calif. concern 's convertible subordinated debentures due 2012 to Caa from B2
It said the reduction reflects impaired business prospects and reduced financial flexibility caused by continuing losses at the maker of Winchester disk drives
VALLEY National Corp. Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its rating on about 400 million of this bank holding company 's senior debt to B2 from Ba3
Moody 's said it expects Valley National of Phoenix Ariz. to make substantial further provisions against its real-estate portfolio and that it continues to suffer from the high cost of carrying nonperforming assets and from high loan-loss provisions
Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage
That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage
Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies said Noel D. Matchett a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc. Silver Spring Md
It may well be that theft of business data is as serious a strategic threat to national security as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms said Michelle Van Cleave the White House 's assistant director for National Security Affairs
The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association a joint industry-government trade group
Any secret can be pirated the experts said if it is transmitted over the air
Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder
They need only position themselves near a company 's satellite dish and wait
You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time Mr. Matchett said adding It 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught
The only way to catch an electronic thief he said is to set him up with erroneous information
Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year most are n't yet taking precautions the experts said
By contrast European firms will spend 150 million this year on electronic security and are expected to spend 1 billion by 1992
Already many foreign firms especially banks have their own cryptographers conference speakers reported
Still encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy
One expert whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he would n't be named or quoted said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers for example doubling as foreign spies
Moreover he said technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they 've been erased from a computer 's memory
He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read
No personal computer not even the one on a chief executive 's desk is safe this speaker noted
W. Mark Goode president of Micronyx Inc. a Richardson Texas firm that makes computer-security products provided a new definition for Mikhail Gorbachev 's campaign for greater openness known commonly as glasnost
Under Mr. Gorbachev Mr. Goode said the Soviets are openly stealing Western corporate communications
He cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East
Among the responses the Swiss trader got was one from the Soviet national shipping company which had n't been invited to submit a bid
The Soviets ' eavesdropping paid off however because they got the contract
The University of Toronto stepped deeper into the contest for Connaught BioSciences Inc. by reaching an unusual agreement with Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp
The University said the two companies agreed to spend 25 million Canadian dollars 21.3 million over 10 years on research at Canadian universities if they are successful in acquiring the vaccine maker
It said 10 million would go to the University of Toronto
Ciba-Geigy and Chiron have made a joint bid of 866 million for Connaught and Institut Merieux S.A. of France has made a rival bid of 942 million
The University is seeking an injunction against the Merieux bid arguing that Connaught 's predecessor company agreed in 1972 that Connaught 's ownership would n't be transferred to foreigners
The university implied that it would drop its opposition to foreign ownership if Ciba-Geigy and Chiron are successful with their lower bid
It said the new agreement would replace the old one that forms the basis of its suit against the Merieux takeover
Notwithstanding foreign ownership of Connaught this accord would enhance research and development in Canada said James Keffer the university 's vice president of research
Ciba-Geigy is a Swiss pharmaceutical company and Chiron is based in Emeryville Calif
In a statement Jacques-Francois Martin director general of Merieux said the French company is still determined to acquire Connaught
While he did n't comment directly on the pact between Ciba-Geigy and the university he said Merieux can transfer new products and technologies to Connaught more rapidly than other companies not currently producing and marketing vaccines who can only promise this for some years in the future

Row 21 of Section 9 of the Upper Reserved at Candlestick Park is a lofty perch only a few steps from the very top of the stands
From my orange seat I looked over the first-base line and the new-mown ball field in the warm sun of the last few minutes before what was to have been the third game of the World Series
It was five in the afternoon but that was Pacific time
Back in New York the work day was already over so I did n't have to feel guilty
Even still I did feel self-indulgent and I could n't help remembering my father 's contempt for a rich medical colleague who would go to watch the Tigers on summer afternoons
This ballpark the Stick was not a classic baseball stadium too symmetrical too much bald concrete
And it did n't have the crowded wild intimacy of Yankee Stadium
But I liked the easy friendliness of the people around me liked it that they 'd brought their children found it charming that true citizens of the state of the future they had brought so many TVs and radios to stay in touch with electroreality at a live event
Maybe it was their peculiar sense of history
The broadcasters were after all documenting the game ratifying its occurrence for millions outside the Stick
Why not watch or hear your experience historicized while you were living it The day was saturated with the weight of its own impending history
Long lines of people waited to buy special souvenir World Series postcards with official postmarks
Thousands of us had paid 5 for the official souvenir book with its historical essays on Series trivia its historical photographs of great moments in Series past and its instructions in English and Spanish for filling in the scorecard
Pitcher = lanzador
Homerun = jonron
Players ran out on the field way below and the stands began to reverberate
It must be a local custom I thought stamping feet to welcome the team
But then the noise turned into a roar
And no one was shouting
No one around me was saying anything
Because we all were busy riding a wave
Sixty thousand surfers atop a concrete wall waiting for the wipeout
Only at the moment of maximum roll did I grasp what was going on
Then I remembered the quake of '71 which I experienced in Santa Barbara in a second-story motel room
When the swaying of the building woke me up I reasoned that a I was in Southern California b the bed was moving c it must be a Magic Fingers bed that had short-circuited
Then I noticed the overhead light was swaying on its cord and realized what had happened
What should I do Get out of the possibly collapsing building to the parking lot
But the lot might split into crevasses so I had better stand on my car which probably was wider than the average crevasse
Fortunately the quake was over before I managed to run out and stand naked on the hood
At the Stick while the world shook I thought of that morning and then it struck me that this time was different
If I survived I would have achieved every journalist 's highest wish
I was an eyewitness of the most newsworthy event on the planet at that moment
What was my angle How would I file All these thoughts raced through my head in the 15 seconds of the earthquake 's actual duration
The rest is of course history
The Stick did n't fall
The real tragedies occurred elsewhere as we soon found out
But for a few minutes there relief abounded
A young mother found her boy who had been out buying a hotdog
The wall behind me was slightly deformed but the center had held
And most of us waited for a while for the game to start
Then we began to file out to wait safely on terra firma for the opening pitch
It was during the quiet exodus down the pristine concrete ramps of the Stick that I really understood the point of all those Walkmen and Watchmen
The crowd moved in clumps clumps magnetized around an electronic nucleus
In this way while the Stick itself was blacked out we kept up to date on events
Within 15 minutes of the quake itself I was able to see pictures of the collapsed section of the Bay Bridge
Increasingly accurate estimates of the severity of the quake became available before I got to my car
And by then expensive automobile sound systems were keeping the gridlocked parking lot by the bay informed about the fire causing the big black plume of smoke we saw on the northern horizon
Darkness fell
But the broadcasts continued through the blacked-out night with pictures of the sandwiched highway ganglion in Oakland and firefighting in the Marina district
By then our little sand village of cars had been linked with a global village of listeners and viewers
Everyone at the Stick that day had started out as a spectator and ended up as a participant
In fact the entire population of the Bay Area had ended up with this dual role of actor and audience
The reporters were victims and some of the victims turned into unofficial reporters
The outstanding example of this was the motorist on the Bay Bridge who had the presence of mind to take out a video camera at the absolutely crucial moment and record the car in front as it fell into the gap in the roadway
The tape was on tv before the night was out
Marshall McLuhan you should have been there at that hour
Investors who received Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's latest stock commentary may be left with blank expressions
The first 10 pages of the 76-page Weekly Portfolio Perspective are completely blank except for the page numbers
Rather than printing devils Shearson puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market
The plunge made Shearson 's market commentary instantly out of date
In fact last Friday 's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise not the least of them brokerage firms such as Shearson that print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week
Shearson a 62%-owned unit of American Express Co. did n't have enough time to update its market commentary so We decided to kill our strategy pieces says Jack Rivkin the head of Shearson 's research department
The first thought some investors had was that a red-faced Shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary and that 's why it purged its pages
Investors recalled that Shearson last week had been advising that the market is still exhibiting all the signs of a further advance
Many other brokerage firms had similarly bullish views
But Mr. Rivkin insists that the 10 pages were n't pulled because they were too bullish
Instead he says they were cautious and that was n't the message we wanted to deliver on Monday
As Mr. Rivkin explains it We were raising some caution flags about rate rises in Europe and concerns about the LBO market
And by late Friday afternoon actually after the close we decided that was the wrong tone to take
With the market down we wanted to tell people to put their orders in on the opening
Both before and after the Friday plunge Shearson has maintained a recommended portfolio weighting of 65 % stocks 20 % bonds and 15 % cash

China 's slide toward recession is beginning to look like a free fall
In a report on China 's foundering economy the official State Statistical Bureau disclosed that industrial output last month rose 0.9 % from a year earlier the lowest growth rate in a decade for September
Retail sales are plummeting while consumer prices still are rising
Chinese and foreign economists now predict prolonged stagflation low growth and high inflation
The economy is crashing hard says an Asian economist in Beijing
The slowdown is taking hold a lot more quickly and devastatingly than anyone had expected
A lengthy recession if it materializes would drain state coffers and create severe hardships for urban workers
Experts predict the coming year will be characterized by flat or negative industrial growth rising unemployment and a widening budget deficit
Unless the government suddenly reverses course wages for most workers wo n't keep pace with inflation creating a potential source of urban unrest
The economy 's slowdown is due only partly to the austerity program launched in September 1988 to cool an overheated economy and tame inflation
Industrial output surged 21 % in 1988 while inflation peaked last February at nearly 30 %
The slowdown also results from chronic energy and raw-materials shortages that force many factories to restrict operations to two or three days a week
In Western market-driven countries recessions often have a bright side prodding the economy to greater efficiency
In China however there is n't likely to be any silver lining because the economy remains guided primarily by the state
Instead China is likely to shell out ever-greater subsidies to its coddled state-run enterprises which ate up 18 billion in bailouts last year
Nor are any of these inefficient monoliths likely to be allowed to go bankrupt
Rather the brunt of the slowdown will be felt in the fast-growing private and semi-private township enterprises which have fallen into disfavor as China 's leaders re-emphasize an orthodox Marxist preference for public ownership
When the going gets rough China penalizes the efficient and rewards the incompetent says a Western economist
Reports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major Communist Party plenum for sometime in the next few weeks
The meeting is expected to call for heightened austerity for two years
But with industrial growth stagnant and inflation showing signs of easing some voices may call for measures to pump new life into the economy
Some analysts believe China soon will begin relaxing economic controls particularly by loosening credit
That would benefit Chinese enterprises as well as Sino-foreign joint ventures both of which have been plagued by shortages of working capital
A dangerous buildup this year of billions of dollars in inter-company debts threatens if unchecked to bring the economy to a collapse
One sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision this week of People 's Bank of China the central bank to allocate 5.4 billion in short-term loans to pay farmers for the autumn harvest the official China Daily reported
But while pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries it also runs the risk of triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation
The cycle has been repeated several times since China began reforming its planned economy in 1979
And because China 's leaders have abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy it is likely to continue analysts say
The statistical bureau 's report cited in China Daily notes that industrial output in September totaled 29.4 billion a rise of just 0.9 % from a year earlier
Output declined in several provinces including Jiangsu and Zhejiang two key coastal areas and Sichuan the nation 's agricultural breadbasket
Production in Shanghai China 's industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government fell 1.8 % for the month
Nationwide output of light industrial products declined 1.8 % the first decline in 10 years a bureau spokesman told China Daily
In an unusually direct statement the bureau spokesman recommended that state banks extend more credit to shopkeepers so that they can purchase manufacturers ' goods
This will prevent a slide in industrial production which will otherwise cause new panic buyings the spokesman said
The 1986 tax overhaul the biggest achievement of President Reagan 's second term is beginning to fall apart and interest groups are lining up for tax goodies all over Capitol Hill
Real-estate executives are lobbying to ease anti-tax-shelter rules
Charitable groups are trying to reinstate the write-off for contributions made by individuals who do n't itemize their deductions
Big auction houses want to make collectibles eligible for lower capital-gains taxes
And heavy-industry lobbyists are quietly discussing the possibility of reinstating the investment tax credit
Everything is up for grabs says Theodore Groom a lobbyist for mutual life-insurance companies
Adds Robert Juliano the head lobbyist for a variety of interests that want to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses It appears as though the whole thing is wide open again
The catalyst has been the congressional move to restore preferential tax treatment for capital gains an effort that is likely to succeed in this Congress
Other fundamental reforms of the 1986 act have been threatened as well
The House seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes
The Senate Finance Committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts and also to bring back income averaging for farmers a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years
As part of the same bill the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations in what committee member Sen. David Pryor D. Ark
calls a feeding frenzy of special-interest legislating
The beneficiaries would range from pineapple growers to rich grandparents to tuxedo-rental shops
To be sure the full Senate facing a fast-approaching budget deadline last Friday stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the Finance Committee bill
But lawmakers of both parties agree that the streamlining was temporary
Other bills will be moving soon that are expected to carry many of the tax cuts including both the capital-gains and IRA provisions
There is n't any doubt that the thread of the '86 code has been given a mighty tug says Rep. Thomas Downey D. N.Y

You 'll see the annual unraveling of it
It 's back to tax-give-away time for the select few says Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania the third-ranking Democrat in the House
Referring to the chairmen of the Senate and House tax-writing committees he adds Next year every special-interest group is going to be there knocking on Lloyd Bentsen 's door on Danny Rostenkowski 's door
Many groups are n't waiting that long
Just last week a House Ways and Means subcommittee held a lengthy meeting to hear the pleas of individual cities companies and interest groups who want to open their own special loopholes
It 's a Swiss-cheese factory and the cheese smells pretty good commented one veteran lobbyist who was watching the proceedings
Even lobbyists for heavy industry one of the interests hit hardest in the 1986 bill are encouraged
The return of pro-investment tax breaks such as those for capital gains and IRAs creates more of a mood or a mindset that is helpful for getting better depreciation write-offs or investment credits says Paul Huard a vice president for the National Association of Manufacturers
Corporate lobbyist Charls Walker is planning a spring conference to discuss what tax changes to make to improve competitiveness
In reaction to proposed capital-gains legislation groups are lobbying to make sure they are n't left off the gravy train
Real-estate interests for example are protesting an omission in President Bush 's capital-gains proposal It does n't include real-estate gains
If there is going to be a tax scheme that contemplates lower treatment of capital gains they certainly want to be part of it says real-estate lobbyist Wayne Thevenot of Concord Associates
In the House-passed tax bill Mr. Thevenot got his wish real-estate assets are included in the capital-gains provision
But Sotheby 's Christie 's and the National Association of Antique Dealers are still trying to get theirs
They have sent a letter to congressional tax-writers asking that gains from the sale of collectibles also be given preferential treatment
Collectibles should continue to be recognized as capital assets the letter states
All of this talk is antithetical to the Tax Reform Act of 1986
In exchange for dramatically lower tax rates the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others
The goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes
Two of the major ways that tax-writers managed to attain these ends were to scrap the preferential treatment of capital gains and to curtail the use of paper losses also known as passive losses that made many tax shelters possible
Many other tax benefits also were swept away
This year Congress with prodding from President Bush has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code
It appears likely that this year or next some form of capital-gains preference and passive-loss restoration will be enacted
Other tax benefits probably will be restored and created
The main obstacle is finding a way to pay for them
The '86 act was a fluke
They wanted reform and they got a revolution says overhaul advocate Rep. Willis Gradison R. Ohio
So is the tax code now open game again Mr. Juliano thinks so
One recent Saturday morning he stayed inside the Capitol monitoring tax-and-budget talks instead of flying to San Francisco for a fund-raiser and then to his hometown of Chicago for the 30th reunion of St. Ignatius High School
I 'm too old to waste a weekend but that 's what I did the 48-year-old Mr. Juliano moans
These days anything can happen
Lufthansa AG said passenger volume climbed 5.2 % for the first nine months of 1989 to 15.3 million passengers from 14.5 million passengers in the year-earlier period
The West German national air carrier said cargo volume jumped 12 % to 638,000 metric tons from 569,000 tons a year ago
Load factor or percentage of seats filled climbed to 67.1 % from 66.6 % even though the number of flights rose 6.9 % to 215,845 in the first-three quarters
From January through September the distance flown by Lufthansa airplanes rose 5.6 % to 266.2 million kilometers from a year earlier the company added
Raymond Chandler in a 1950 letter defending a weak Hemingway book likened a champion writer to a baseball pitcher
When the champ has lost his stuff the great mystery novelist wrote when he can no longer throw the high hard one he throws his heart instead
He throws something
He does n't just walk off the mound and weep
Chandler might have been predicting the course of his own career
His last published novel featuring private detective Philip Marlowe the inferior Playback 1958 at times read almost like a parody of his previous work
When he died in 1959 Chandler left behind four chapters of yet another Marlowe book The Poodle Springs Story which seemed to go beyond parody into something like burlesque
Champ Chandler 's last pitch apparently was a screwball
Now Robert Parker author of several best sellers featuring Spenser a contemporary private eye in the Marlowe mold has with the blessings of the Chandler estate been hired to complete The Poodle Springs Story
The result Poodle Springs Putnam 's 288 pages 18.95 is an entertaining easy to read and fairly graceful extension of the Marlowe chronicle full of hard-boiled wisecracks and California color
If it does not quite have Chandler 's special magic well at the end neither did Chandler
As the book begins a newly wed Marlowe roars into the desert resort of Poodle a.k.a
Palm Springs at the wheel of a Cadillac Fleetwood
His bride is the rich and beautiful Linda Loring a character who also appeared in Chandler 's The Long Goodbye and Playback
Philip and Linda move into her mansion and ca n't keep their hands off each other even in front of the Hawaiian\/Japanese houseman
But the lovebirds have a conflict
He wants to continue being a low-paid private eye and she wants him to live off the million dollars she 's settled on him
That 's Chandler 's setup
Mr. Parker spins it into a pretty satisfying tale involving Poodle Springs high life Hollywood low life and various folk who hang their hats in both worlds
The supporting lineup is solid the patter is amusing and there 's even a cameo by Bernie Ohls the good cop of previous Chandler books who still does n't hesitate to have Marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes
The style throughout bears a strong resemblance to Chandler 's prose at its most pared down
All told Mr. Parker does a better job of making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might have had a right to expect
But there are grounds for complaint
At one point the reader is two steps ahead of Marlowe in catching on to a double identity scam and Marlowe is supposed to be the pro
More bothersome there are several apparent anachronisms
Contact lenses tank tops prostitutes openly working the streets of Hollywood and the Tequila Sunrise cocktail all seem out of place in the 1950s
A little more care in re-creating Marlowe 's universe would have made the book that much more enjoyable
Mr. Nolan is a contributing editor at Los Angeles Magazine
Ko Shioya spent eight years as the editor in chief of the Japanese edition of Reader 's Digest
Japan has been a major importer of foreign information and news says Mr. Shioya
But one gets fed up with importing information and news
Mr. Shioya has turned the tables
Today he is publisher of Business Tokyo magazine the first English-language business magazine devoted to coverage of Japanese business
After a slick redesign the two-year-old magazine has been relaunched this month by its parent company Keizaikai Corp. the Tokyo-based company with interests that include financial services book publishing and a tourist agency
Printed in the U.S. and carrying the line The Insider 's Japan Business Tokyo 's October cover story was The World 's No. 1 Customer Japanese women
Keizaikai is one of a small but growing band of Japanese companies taking their first steps into American publishing after making major investments in entertainment real estate and banking companies here
Japanese concerns have retained a number of publishing consultants and media brokers to study the U.S. market including the New York-based investment banker Veronis Suhler & Associates
And they are quietly linking up with U.S. publishing trade groups
Japanese publishers want to be introduced to the publishing and information industries said John Veronis chairman of Veronis Suhler
While there are n't any major deals in the works currently on the scale of Sony Corp. 's recent 3.4 billion agreement to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. observers do n't rule out a transaction of that size
The Japanese take the long view
said Mr. Veronis
It may not be weeks or months but they are also opportunistic and if they feel comfortable they will move on a deal he said
In recent months three big Tokyo-based publishing concerns including Nikkei Business Publications Nikkei Home no relation and Magazine House applied for membership in Magazine Publishers of America which represents almost all U.S. consumer magazines
Japanese involvement in American publishing has been so small to date that magazines such as Business Tokyo are considered groundbreakers
When Keizaikai launched Business Tokyo in 1987 it appealed to a more multinational audience
The magazine was overhauled with the aid of American magazine design gurus Milton Glaser and Walter Bernard and targets top-level U.S. executives with Japanese and American advertisers
American publishers appear more than ready to do some selling
Susumu Ohara president of Nihon Keizai Shinbun America Inc. publisher of the Japan Economic Journal said he receives telephone calls weekly from media bankers on whether his parent company is interested in buying a U.S. consumer or business magazine
The Japanese are in the early stage right now said Thomas Kenney a onetime media adviser for First Boston Corp. who was recently appointed president of Reader 's Digest Association 's new Magazine Publishing Group
Before they were interested in hard assets and they saw magazines as soft
Now they realize magazines are as much a franchise as Nabisco is a franchise
Bell Atlantic Corp. and Southern New England Telecommunications posted strong profit gains for the third quarter while Nynex Corp. Pacific Telesis Group and U S West Inc. reported earnings declines for the period
Rate settlements in Minnesota and Colorado depressed U S West 's third-quarter profit
Denver-based U S West said net income dropped 8.9 % noting that the year-ago quarter included the sale of a building by its BetaWest Properties unit
Revenue dropped 4.3 % to 2.3 billion from 2.4 billion reflecting declines in its consumer-telephone sector long-distance carrier business and diversified division
Revenue from business-telephone operations grew 3.3 % to 618.9 million from 599.4 million a year ago
New telephone lines posted healthy growth
Overall they increased 2.8 % to 12.1 million putting U S West over the 12 million mark for the first time
Business lines increased 3.7 % to 3.3 million
On a truly comparable basis we 've seen modest earnings growth this year from the operations of our company said Jack MacAllister chairman and chief executive officer
The major negative factor was the cumulative impact of regulatory activity over the past two years
He said the company expects to be on target with analysts ' projections by year end but conceded that the fourth quarter represents a significant challenge
Expenses in the quarter dropped 11.2 % to 664.3 million from 747.7 million a year ago
Yesterday U S West shares rose 75 cents to close at 71.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic said net rose 6.5 % aided by strong growth in the network-services business and an increase in the number of new telephone lines
Revenue jumped 5.6 % to 2.9 billion from 2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter
Revenue from financial and real-estate services jumped 23 % to 177.4 million from 144.1 million a year ago
Network-access revenue from long-distance telephone companies increased 6.4 % to 618.6 million
Bell Atlantic added 148,000 new telephone lines in the quarter for a total of 16.9 million
The company said per-share earnings were slightly reduced by the sale of 4.1 million shares of treasury stock to the company 's newly formed Employee Stock Ownership Plans
In composite trading on the Big Board Bell Atlantic closed at 100.625 up 1.50 a share
At Nynex net slumped 14.8 % primarily because of a continuing strike by 60,000 employees lower-than-expected profit at its New York Telephone unit and significantly higher taxes and costs
State and local taxes increased to 131.3 million from 99.1 million a year ago
Nynex said expenses rose 4.5 % to 2.73 billion from 2.61 billion a 119 million increase
Most of the higher costs were associated with acquisitions and growth in nonregulated business units it added
Our net income is n't where we would want it to be at this point said William C. Ferguson chairman and chief executive officer
This deviation from our past growth patterns is caused largely by lower earnings at New York Telephone
Mr. Ferguson said a continued softness in New York City area 's economy and increased competition particularly in the private-line market took a heavy toll on earnings
The three-month-old strike at Nynex seriously hurt the installation of new telephone lines in the quarter
Nynex said access lines in service at the end of the quarter were off 18,000 from the previous quarter which reported an increase of 160,000 new access lines
Revenue rose to 3.31 billion from 3.18 billion mostly from acquisition of AGS Computers and robust non-regulated businesses
In Big Board composite trading yesterday Nynex common closed at 81.125 up 1.625
Southern New England Telecommunications which bolstered its marketing efforts for telephone and non-telephone subsidiaries reported that net increased 8.1 %
Walter H. Monteith Jr. SNET chairman and chief executive officer said Innovative marketing of our products and services contributed to increase revenue
Revenue and sales increased 7.5 % to 423.9 million from 394.4 million a year earlier
Yellow pages advertising sales rose 11.8 % to 41.2 million
Cost and expenses for the quarter excluding interest increased 6.1 % to 333.3 million from 314 million the year before
SNET common rose 1.25 to 85.50 a share yesterday in composite trading on the Big Board
San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis said net declined 12.6 % primarily because of regulatory action
Revenue was about flat at 2.4 billion
Revenue was reduced 33 million by three extraordinary items a California Public Utilities Commission refund for an American Telephone & Telegraph Co. billing adjustment a provision for productivity sharing to be paid to customers in 1990 and a one-time accrual for a toll settlement with long-distance telephone companies
Excluding the one-time charges the company would have posted earnings of 298 million or 73 cents a share
The company also was hurt by a 289 million rate reduction that went into effect in 1989
This is a good quarter for us in terms of our business fundamentals said Sam Ginn chairman and chief executive officer
Pacific Telesis said new telephone lines increased 4.5 % for a total of about 13.5 million for the quarter toll calls increased 9.6 % to 807 million and minutes of telephone usage increased to 9.9 billion
In Big Board composite trading yesterday Pacific Telesis common closed at 45.50 up 87.5 cents
a Includes a one-time gain of 88.7 million from a commonstock sale by U S West 's U S West New Vector Group
b Includes a 41.3 million gain on the sale of FiberCom
Amoco Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 39 % to 336 million or 65 cents a share as gasoline refining and marketing profits lagged substantially behind last year 's record level
A charge of 80 million related to projected environmental costs in its refining and marketing operations further depressed results
A spokesman said Amoco completed an environmental analysis last quarter but that no single clean-up project was responsible
In the 1988 third quarter the Chicago-based oil company earned 552 million or 1.07 a share
Revenue in the latest quarter rose 12 % to 6.6 billion from 5.91 billion
Aside from the special charge Amoco 's results were in line with Wall Street estimates
The company 's stock ended at 48.375 up 25 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
Amoco is the first major oil company to report third-quarter results
Analysts expect others to show a similar pattern
Generally in the quarter overproduction of gasoline and higher crude oil prices pressured profitability
The industry 's chemical profits also declined because excess capacity has depressed prices
Gasoline margins may rebound this quarter some industry officials say but they believe chemical margins could worsen
American Petrofina Inc. a Dallas-based integrated oil company yesterday said its third-quarter earnings declined by more than half
Fina blamed lower chemical prices reduced gasoline margins and refinery maintenance shutdowns
It said net income dropped to 15.1 million or 98 cents a share from 35.2 million or 2.66 a share
Sales rose 2.2 % to 711.9 million from 696.1 million
Amoco 's refining and marketing profit in the quarter fell to 134 million from 319 million
Chemical earnings declined by one-third to 120 million last year 's robust levels
Amoco 's domestic oil and natural gas operations recorded a profit of 104 million in the quarter compared with a loss of 5 million primarily on the strength of higher crude oil prices said Chairman Richard M. Morrow
Amoco also sharply boosted natural-gas output part of it from properties acquired from Tenneco Inc. last year
But foreign exploration and production earnings fell sharply to 12 million from 95 million
Higher oil prices were n't enough to offset a roughly 20 million charge related to a 10 % reduction in Amoco 's Canadian work force as well as increased exploration expenses
For the nine months Amoco said that net income fell to 1.29 billion from 1.69 billion but if unusual items are excluded operations produced essentially flat results
Revenue rose 12 % to 19.93 billion from 17.73 billion
James F. Gero former chairman and chief executive officer of Varo Inc. and Richard J. Hatchett III a Dallas investment banker were elected directors of this medical-products concern boosting the board to seven members
For retailers Christmas not Halloween promises to be this year 's spookiest season
Many retailers fear a price war will erupt if cash-strapped companies such as Campeau Corp. slash tags to spur sales
Concerns about the stock market doubts about the economy in general and rising competition from catalog companies also haunt store operators
Profits at Christmas could be under attack for every retailer asserts Norman Abramson president and chief operating officer of Clothestime Inc. an off-price chain
Even if there is n't any widespread discounting the outlook for industry profits is n't good
Management Horizons forecasts a 1.4 % profit decline for non-auto retailers this year after annual drops that averaged 4.5 % in 1988 and 1987
For the last two and a half years retailing has been in a mild recession says Carl Steidtmann chief economist at the Columbus Ohio consulting firm
This year many stores are entering the Christmas season in turmoil Bonwit Teller and B. Altman parent L.J. Hooker Corp. is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code B.A.T Industries PLC 's healthy Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field 's chains are on the auction block Campeau 's Bloomingdale 's is also on the block
Industry observers expect a wide divergence in performance
Stores in a state of confusion are likely to fare poorly and to lose customers to stable chains such as Limited Inc. May Department Stores Co. and Dillard Department Stores Inc. which should do well
There are going to be very clear winners and very clear losers says Cynthia Turk a Touche Ross & Co. retail consultant
Says Mr. Steidtmann I 'm looking for a bi-polar Christmas
Economists expect general merchandise sales in the fourth quarter to rise 4.5 % to 6 % from year-ago figures
But Mr. Steidtmann predicts that healthy stores hawking mostly apparel could ring up gains of as much as 25 % to 30 %
Troubled chains could see their sales drop as much as 8 % he believes as managers distracted by fears about the future allow their stores to get sloppy
Thin merchandise selections at the most troubled chains are also expected to hurt sales
Catalog companies are likely to pose a bigger threat to all stores this year particularly in December
More than 200 catalog outfits are promoting a low-cost Federal Express service that guarantees pre-Christmas delivery of orders made by a certain date
Traditionally consumers were concerned about ordering after the first of December because they did n't believe they would get it by Christmas says Adam Strum chairman of the Wine Enthusiast Inc. which sells wine cellars and accessories through the mail
Using Federal Express delivery last year Mr. Strum says December was our biggest month
Even Sears Roebuck & Co. is getting into the act offering for the first time to have Federal Express deliver toys ordered by Dec. 20 from its Wish Book catalog
K mart Corp. Chairman Joseph E. Antonini summed up his outlook for the Christmas season as not troublesome
He 's not predicting a blockbuster but he is more optimistic than three months ago because employment remains strong and inflation low
Other retailers are also preparing for a ho-hum holiday
Philip M. Hawley chairman of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. expects sales at department stores open at least a year to rise a modest 3 % to 5 % over last year 's totals both for his company and the industry in general
I 'm not looking for a runaway Christmas at all he says
It is n't a real boom holiday season in our eyes says Woolworth Corp. Chairman Harold E. Sells but it is n't going to be a bust either
Mr. Sells expects fourth-quarter sales at his company which besides Woolworth stores includes Kinney and Foot Locker shoe stores and other specialty chains to rise pretty much in line with its year-to-date increases of between 8 % and 9 %
The estimate includes the results of new stores
A consumer poll conducted in early September by Leo J. Shapiro & Associates a market researcher based in Chicago also suggests a modest holiday
Of the 450 survey respondents 35 % said they expect to spend less buying Christmas gifts this year than last year while 28 % said they expect to spend more and 37 % said their gift budget would stay the same
The results are almost identical to Shapiro 's September 1988 numbers
Retailers could get a boost this year from the calendar
Christmas falls on a Monday creating a big last-minute weekend opportunity for stores
Most will stay open late Saturday night and open their doors again Sunday
But many consumers probably will use the extra time to put off some purchasing until the last minute
What you 'll hear as we get into December is that sales are sluggish predicts Woolworth 's Mr. Sells
The week ending the 24th is going to save the entire month for everyone
The Spanish author Camilo Jose Cela won the Nobel Prize for literature yesterday a surprising choice but given the Swedish Academy 's past perversities hardly the most undeserved and ridiculous accolade handed out by the awarding committee
In Spain anyway the 73-year-old Mr. Cela enjoys some renown for the novels and travel books he wrote during the parched Franco years the everyday poverty and stagnant atmosphere of which he described in brutally direct vivid prose beginning with The Family of Pascal Duarte 1942
Unlike other writers who either battled the fascists during the Civil War or left Spain when Franco triumphed Mr. Cela fought briefly on the general 's side no doubt earning with his war wound some forbearance when he went on to depict a country with a high population of vagabonds murderers and rural idiots trudging aimlessly through a dried-out land
Still it was in Argentine editions that his countrymen first read his story of Pascal Duarte a field worker who stabbed his mother to death and has no regrets as he awaits his end in a prison cell Fate directs some men down the flower-bordered path and others down the road bordered with thistles and prickly pears
The lucky ones gaze out at life with serene eyes and smile with a face of innocence at their perfumed happiness
The others endure the hot sun of the plains and scowl like cornered wild beasts
Mr. Cela himself was one of the lucky ones his fortunes steadily increasing over the decades he spent putting out some 70 travelogues novels short story collections and poetry
These days he is as known for his flamboyant tastes and the youthful muse who shares his life as he is for his books
The man who wore out his shoes wandering around Guadalajara in 1958 describing in his travel book Viaje a la Alcarria how he scrounged for food and stayed in squalid inns now tours Spain in a Rolls-Royce
Of his 10 novels The Hive 1951 full of sharp vignettes of Madrid life and centered on a cafe run by Dona Rosa a foul-mouthed broad-based woman with blackened little teeth encrusted in filth used to be available in English translated by J.M. Cohen and published by Ecco Press which now no doubt regrets relinquishing its copyright
Here is an excerpt The lonely woman walks on in the direction of the Plaza de Alonso Martinez
Two men have a conversation behind one of the windows of the cafe on the corner of the boulevard
Both are young one twenty odd the other thirty odd
The older one looks like a member of the jury for a literary award the younger one looks like a novelist
It is evident that their conversation runs more or less on the following lines I 've submitted the manuscript of my novel under the title Teresa de Cepeda ' and in it I 've treated a few neglected aspects of that eternal problem which Oh yes
Will you pour me a drop of water if you do n't mind With pleasure
I 've revised it several times and I think I may say with pride that there is not a single discordant word in the whole text
How interesting
I think so
I do n't know the quality of the works my colleagues have sent in but in any case I feel confident that good sense and honest judgment Rest assured we proceed with exemplary fairness
I do n't doubt it for a moment
It does not matter if one is defeated provided the work that gets the award has unmistakable qualities
What 's so discouraging is In passing the window Senorita Elvira gives them a smile simply out of habit
Ashland Oil Inc. said it will take after-tax charges of 78 million or 1.40 a share in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30
Because of the charge Ashland expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter and significantly lower results for fiscal 1989
The oil refiner said it will report fiscal fourth quarter and 1989 results next week
The company earned 66 million or 1.19 a share on revenue of 2.1 billion in the year-ago fourth quarter
For fiscal 1988 Ashland had net of 224 million or 4.01 a share on revenue of 7.8 billion
Both revenue figures exclude excise taxes
The charges consist of a 25 million after-tax charge to cover cost overruns in Ashland 's Riley Consolidated subsidiary a previously announced 38 million after-tax charge resulting from a 325 million settlement with National Iranian Oil Co. and a 15 million after-tax charge from the previously announced sale of its Ashland Technology Corp. subsidiary
Ashland expects that sale to be complete next year
The charge for the Riley subsidiary is for expected costs to correct problems with certain bed boilers built for utilities
The charge will be added to 20 million in reserves established a year ago to cover the cost overruns
When President Bush arrives here next week for a hemispheric summit organized to commemorate a century of Costa Rican democracy will he be able to deliver a credible message in the wake of the Panamanian fiasco Undoubtedly Mr. Bush will be praised by some Latin leaders prone to pay lip service to nonintervention while they privately encourage more assertive U.S. action to remove Gen. Manuel Noriega and safeguard their countries from a Sandinista onslaught
The Panamanian affair is only the tip of a more alarming iceberg
It originates in a Bush administration decision not to antagonize the U.S. Congress and avoid at all costs being accused of meddling in the region
The result has been a dangerous vacuum of U.S. leadership which leaves Central America open to Soviet adventurism
The influence of the U.S. is not being felt in Central America Washington 's decisions do not respond to a policy and are divorced from reality says Fernando Volio a Costa Rican congressman and former foreign minister
The disarray of the Bush administration 's Latin diplomacy was evident in the failure of the Organization of American States to condemn categorically Gen. Noriega
Faced with this embarrassment U.S. diplomats expressed confidence that the influential Rio Group of South American nations which gathered last week in Peru would take a stronger posture toward the Panamanian dictator
But other than a few slaps on the wrist Gen. Noriega went unpunished by that body too he was not even singled out in the closing statement
Now Mr. Bush will come to Costa Rica and encounter Nicaraguan strongman Daniel Ortega eager for photo opportunities with the U.S. president
The host Costa Rican President Oscar Arias did not invite Chile Cuba Panama or Haiti to the summit which was to be restricted to democracies
However Mr. Ortega was included
Formally upgrading the Sandinistas to a democratic status was an initiative harshly criticized in the Costa Rican press
Even Carlos Manuel Castillo the presidential candidate for Mr. Arias 's National Liberation Party made public his opposition to the presence of Nicaragua in a democratic festivity
Nevertheless the Bush administration agreed to the dubious arrangement in July a few weeks before the Central American presidents met in Tela Honduras to discuss a timetable for disbanding the anti-Sandinista rebels
According to officials in Washington the State Department hoped that by pleasing President Arias it would gain his support to postpone any decision on the Contras until after Mr. Ortega 's promises of democratic elections were tested next February
However relying on an ardent critic of the Reagan administration and the Contra movement for help in delaying the disarming of the Contras was risky business
And even some last-minute phone calls that Mr. Bush made at the behest of some conservative U.S. senators to enlist backing for the U.S. position failed to stop the march of Mr. Arias 's agenda
Prior to this episode Sen. Christopher Dodd D. Conn. sensing an open field undertook a personal diplomatic mission through Central America to promote an early disbanding of the rebels
Visiting Nicaragua he praised the Sandinistas for their electoral system and chided the Bush administration for not rewarding the Sandinistas
In Honduras where the Contras are a hot political issue he promised to help unblock some 70 million in assistance withheld due to the failure of local agencies to comply with conditions agreed upon with Washington
Aid was also the gist of the talks Sen. Dodd had with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani Mr. Cristiani 's government is very much at the mercy of U.S. largess and is forced to listen very carefully to Sen. Dodd 's likes and dislikes
It was therefore not surprising that close allies of the U.S. virtually neglected by the Bush administration ordered the Nicaraguan insurgents dismantled by December long before the elections
Fittingly the Tela Accords were nicknamed by Hondurans the Dodd plan
The individual foreign policy carried out by U.S. legislators adds to a confusing U.S. performance that has emboldened Soviet initiatives in Central America
On Oct. 3 following conversations with Secretary of State James Baker Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Managua to acclaim Nicaragua 's great peace efforts
There Mr. Shevardnadze felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan The U.S.S.R. would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to Nicaragua after the February election if the U.S. did likewise with its allies in Central America
He also called on Nicaragua 's neighbors to accept a military equilibrium guaranteed by both superpowers
The Pentagon claims that in spite of Moscow 's words East bloc weapons continue to flow into Nicaragua through Cuba at near-record levels
Since Mr. Shevardnadze 's proposals followed discussions with Mr. Baker speculations arose that the Bush administration was seeking an accommodation with the Soviets in Central America
This scheme would fit the Arias Plan which declared a false symmetry between Soviet military aid to the Sandinista dictatorship and that provided by Washington to freely elected governments
Furthermore it is also likely to encourage those on Capitol Hill asking for cuts in the assistance to El Salvador if President Cristiani does not bend to demands of the Marxist guerrillas
The sad condition of U.S. policy in Central America is best depicted by the recent end to U.S. sponsorship of Radio Costa Rica
In 1984 the Costa Rican government requested help to establish a radio station in the northern part of the country flooded by airwaves of Sandinista propaganda
Recovering radiophonic sovereignty was the purpose of Radio Costa Rica funded by the U.S. and affiliated with the Voice of America VOA
A few months ago the Bush administration decided to stop this cooperation leaving Radio Costa Rica operating on a shoestring
According to news reports the abrupt termination was due to fears that VOA transmissions could interfere with the peace process
In the meantime Russia gave Nicaragua another powerful radio transmitter which has been installed in the city of Esteli
It is capable of reaching the entire Caribbean area and deep into North America
Perhaps its loud signal may generate some awareness of the Soviet condominium being created in the isthmus thanks to U.S. default
The Soviet entrenchment in Nicaragua is alarming for Costa Rica a peaceful democracy without an army
Questioned in Washington about what would happen if his much-heralded peace plan would fail President Arias voiced expectations of direct U.S. action
A poll conducted in July by a Gallup affiliate showed that 64 % of Costa Ricans believe that if their country is militarily attacked by either Nicaragua or Panama the U.S. will come to its defense
But in the light of events in Panama where the U.S. has such clear strategic interests waiting for the Delta Force may prove to be a dangerous gambit

Holiday Corp. said net income jumped 89 % partly on the strength of record operating income in its gaming division
Separately the hotel and gambling giant said it was proceeding with plans to make a tender offer and solicit consents with respect to approximately 1.4 billion of its publicly traded debt
That debt is part of the 2.1 billion of Holiday debt that Bass PLC of Britain said it would retire or assume when it agreed to buy the Holiday Inn business in August
Holiday said third-quarter earnings rose to 39.8 million or 1.53 a share from 21 million or 84 cents a share a year earlier
Results for the quarter included 19.2 million in pretax gains from property transactions including the sale of one Embassy Suites hotel and 3.5 million of nonrecurring costs associated with the acquisition of the Holiday Inn business by Bass
Holiday said operating income related to gaming increased 4.5 % to a record 61.4 million from 58.8 million a year earlier
The jump reflected record results in Las Vegas Nev. and Atlantic City N.J. as well as a full quarter 's results from Harrah 's Del Rio in Laughlin Nev
Third-quarter revenue rose 2.7 % to 433.5 million from 422.1 million
For the nine months earnings fell 2.9 % to 99.1 million or 3.86 a share from 102.1 million or 4.10 a share a year earlier
Revenue dropped 1.6 % to 1.21 billion from 1.23 billion
The tender offer and consent solicitation will be made to debtholders in December
In effect Holiday is asking holders for permission for Bass to buy their debt
Holiday said Salomon Brothers Inc. has been retained to act as the dealer-manager and financial adviser in connection with the offer and solicitation
The debt issues involved and the proposed consent fees and cash tender offer prices expressed per 1,000 of principal amount are as follows 10 1\/2 % senior notes due 1994 at 101 % 11 % subordinated debt due 1999 at 102 % 9 3\/8 % notes due 1993 at 100 % and 8 3\/8 % notes due 1996 at 95.25 %
Holiday said its 15 % notes due 1992 also will be included in the tender offer and consent solicitation at a price to be determined by Holiday prior to the commencement of the offer
The television units of Paramount Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. are exploring the possibility of offering prime-time programming to independent stations two nights a week industry executives say
Although such a venture would n't match the fourth network created by News Corp. 's Fox Broadcasting Co. MCA and Paramount may have similar ambitions
Fox which also owns six TV stations provides programs three nights a week to those and other affiliates
Paramount Domestic TV and MCA TV formed a joint venture last month named Premier Advertiser Sales to sell advertising in programs syndicated by both companies such as Star Trek the Next Generation Charles in Charge and Friday the 13th the Series
A spokeswoman for Paramount said the company does n't comment on speculation
Calls to Shelly Schwab president of MCA TV were n't returned
The two companies like Fox already have their own TV stations
MCA owns WWOR in New York and Paramount last month agreed to purchase a 79 % stake in the TVX Broadcast Group from Salomon Inc. in a deal valued at 140 million
TVX owns five stations including WTXF a Fox affiliate in Philadelphia
One broadcasting executive familiar with the project said the co-venture would target stations affiliated with Fox because Fox has the desirable independent stations in most of the key cities
Currently Fox supplies programs on Saturdays Sundays and Mondays although the company plans to expand to other weeknights
Jamie Kellner president of Fox Broadcasting said We believe the partnership of Fox its affiliates and advertisers is succeeding and will continue to grow
Another Fox official who declined to be identified said Fox was n't pleased by the possible Paramount-MCA venture into prime-time programming
To make the venture work they would need Fox affiliates he said
We spent a lot of time and money in building our group of stations he said adding that Fox does n't appreciate another company attempting to usurp its station lineup
Fox said it plans to offer its stations movies theatrical and made-for-TV ventures probably on Wednesdays sometime next year
It is also planning another night of original series
Paramount and MCA according to the broadcasting executive plan to offer theatrical movies produced separately by Paramount and MCA for Wednesdays and perhaps a block of original shows Fridays
The executive said Paramount and MCA have also held discussions with Chris-Craft Industries ' broadcasting unit which owns five independent stations in cities such as Los Angeles San Francisco and Portland Ore
A Chris-Craft station manager said there have been no formal talks
I think it 's to Fox 's advantage to be associated with the Paramount-MCA venture said Michael Conway station manager of WTXF the TVX station that is a Fox affiliate
Mr. Conway said the Fox shows appearing on nights when Paramount-MCA shows would n't be offered could be promoted on the programs produced by Paramount-MCA
Michael Fisher general manager of KTXL a Fox affiliate in Sacramento Calif. said The real question is whether the Paramount-MCA offering is practical
It is n't
Why would I consider giving up Fox a proven commodity for an unknown venture Fox attracts a young audience with shows such as Married With Children its most successful series
Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and BanPonce Corp. agreed to merge in a transaction valued at 324 million
Under the agreement BanPonce stockholders will be able to exchange each of their shares for either shares in the new entity or cash
In each case the exchange is valued at 56.25 a share
The two companies both based in San Juan will form a bank holding company with assets of just over 9 billion
The holding company will be called BanPonce Corp
The primary subsidiary will be the combined banking operations of the two companies and will be known as Banco Popular de Puerto Rico
Rafael Carrion Jr. chairman of Banco Popular will be the chairman of the holding company
Alberto M. Paracchini currently chairman of BanPonce will serve as president of the bank holding company and chairman of the subsidiary
Banco Popular originally proposed the merger in July in a cash and stock transaction valued at 50 a share or about 293 million
BanPonce reacted cooly at first but appeared to be won over analysts said by Banco Popular 's assurances that it wanted only a friendly transaction
Banco Popular just kept waiting said Edward Thompson a vice president and analyst at Thomson BankWatch Inc. in New York
They got a transaction that 's good for both companies
The two banks appear to be a good fit
BanPonce caters to a more affluent customer while Banco Popular has always had a large presence among middle-income and lower-income markets
The merger should also allow the companies to reduce costs by combining operations in many locations in Puerto Rico
They 're often right across the street from one another Mr. Thompson said
Richard Carrion who is currently president and chief executive officer of Banco Popular said the merger will result in a larger and stronger locally based bank
Mr. Carrion who will now serve as president and chief executive officer of the subsidiary bank added We 'll be able to better compete with large foreign banks
It makes sense from a strategic standpoint
The newly merged company will have 165 branches in Puerto Rico and 27 branches outside of the island
The banks said they do n't expect the merger to face any regulatory hurdles
Mr. Carrion said the merger should be completed in six to nine months
Hit by higher costs and lower sales Caterpillar Inc. said third-quarter earnings tumbled 43 % and full-year earnings will trail last year 's results
The construction equipment maker said third-quarter profit fell to 108 million or 1.07 a share from 190 million or 1.87 a share a year earlier
Sales dropped 6 % to 2.58 billion from 2.74 billion reflecting eight fewer business days in the latest quarter
The company which is in a costly modernization program said earnings were hurt by higher start-up and new program costs increased costs of materials higher wages and an 11 million provision for bad debts in Latin America
In announcing a 1989 capital spending plan of 950 million early this year Caterpillar said full-year earnings would be flat compared with last year 's 616 million or 6.07 a share
But yesterday the company said this year 's profit will be lower
It did n't say by how much
Suffering from a downturn in heavy truck production that cut orders for its engines Caterpillar also said it will indefinitely lay off about 325 workers in the Peoria area and temporarily shut its plant in York Pa. for two weeks in both November and December
For the first nine months of the year Caterpillar said earnings fell 14 % to 390 million or 3.85 a share from 453 million or 4.46 a share a year earlier
Sales rose to 8.19 billion from 7.65 billion
Millicom Inc. said it is one of two companies to receive a license to introduce and operate a cellular mobile telephone system in Pakistan
The market during the start-up is estimated at 25,000 subscribers
A spokeswoman for Millicom a telecommunications company said she did n't know the value of the contract
Cable & Wireless PLC of Britain won the other license
Millicom said it would build and operate the system in Pakistan with Comvik International AB part of the Kinnevik group of Sweden and Arfeen International Pakistan
B.A.T Industries PLC won overwhelming shareholder approval for a defensive restructuring to fend off a 13.35 billion 21.23 billion takeover bid from Sir James Goldsmith
At a shareholders ' meeting in London the tobacco financial-services and retailing giant said it received 99.9 % approval from voting holders for plans to spin off about 6 billion in assets
B.A.T aims to sell such U.S. retailing units as Marshall Field and Saks Fifth Avenue and float its big paper and British retailing businesses via share issues to existing holders
Proceeds will help pay for a planned buy-back of 10 % or about 153 million of its shares and a 50 % dividend increase
B.A.T yesterday started its share buy-back
The company said it acquired 2.5 million shares for 785 pence 12.48 each or a total of 19.6 million 31.2 million from its broker Barclays de Zoete Wedd
The share buy-back plan is likely to underpin B.A.T 's share price
B.A.T said it may make more equity purchases until the close of business today depending on market conditions but will cease further purchases until Nov. 22 when it releases third-quarter results
B.A.T shares rose 29 pence to 783 pence on London 's stock exchange yesterday
Shareholder approval sets the stage for a lengthy process of restructuring that might not be completed until next year 's second half
Before the recent tumult in global financial markets B.A.T officials holders and analysts had expected a substantial part of the restructuring to be complete by the end of the first half
We are not in any hurry to sell Saks Marshall Field or B.A.T 's other U.S. retail properties said Chairman Patrick Sheehy
This is n't a distress sale
We are determined to get good prices
Company officials say the flotations of the paper and British retailing businesses are likely only after the disposals of the U.S. retailing assets
Meanwhile Sir James still is pursuing efforts to gain U.S. insurance regulators ' approval for a change in control of B.A.T 's Farmers Group Inc. unit
The Anglo-French financier has indicated he intends to bid again for B.A.T if he receives approval
Hasbro Inc. the nation 's largest toy maker reported third-quarter earnings increased 73 % from a year earlier on a 9.4 % sales gain reflecting improved margins
Hasbro said it had net income of 31.3 million or 53 cents a share up from 18.1 million or 31 cents a share a year earlier when it took a pretax charge of 10 million after dropping development of an interactive video entertainment system
Revenue rose to 403 million from 368.4 million
The company cited sales gains at its Milton Bradley and Playskool units and in its international business for the increase in revenue
Alan G. Hassenfeld chairman and chief executive added that Hasbro 's new line of battery-powered racing cars called Record Breakers and its acquisition of Cabbage Patch Kids Scrabble and other lines from Coleco Industries Inc. puts the company in a good position as we enter the Christmas buying season
For the first nine months of the year Hasbro 's net income rose 33 % to 68.2 million or 1.15 a share from 51.3 million or 88 cents a share on a 3.1 % increase in revenue to 992.7 million from 963 million a year earlier
Reebok International Ltd. posted a 35 % increase in third-quarter net income despite a slight decline in sales
The athletic footwear maker said net rose to 49.9 million or 44 cents a share from 37.1 million or 32 cents a share a year earlier
Sales declined 3 % to 524.5 million from 539.4 million
Paul Fireman Reebok chairman and chief executive officer said Our gains in earnings provide further evidence that the controls we have put in place and our sales mix are continuing to improve the company 's overall profit performance
The company said it expects sales to improve due to a number of new products including a pump basketball shoe that can be inflated to better fit the foot
In the first nine months net was 140 million or 1.23 a share on sales of 1.44 billion
Separately Reebok completed the acquisition of CML Group Inc. 's Boston Whaler unit a builder of power boats
CML Acton Mass. had agreed to sell the unit to Reebok for about 42 million
The agreement also called for Reebok to receive warrants to purchase 400,000 shares of CML common at 31.25 a share exercisable at any time before July 1 An outside spokesman for CML said the terms were changed to a minor extent but would n't disclose what those changes were
Pitney Bowes Inc. directors authorized the company to seek buyers for its Wheeler Group Inc. subsidiary a direct mail marketer of office supplies
Pitney Bowes said the decision was based on a long-term analysis of the compatibility of Wheeler Group 's marketing business with other Pitney Bowes operations
Pitney Bowes acquired the core of what evolved into Wheeler Group in 1979 by buying Dictaphone Corp
A spokeswoman would n't comment on whether the company had talked with any potential buyers for the New Hartford Conn. unit which had 1988 sales of about 75 million
She said Wheeler Group was profitable but would n't give figures
The spokeswoman said the company does n't have a timetable for the sale adding that the board 's decision just starts the search for a buyer
Separately Pitney Bowes said third-quarter net income gained 15 % to 62 million or 78 cents a share from 54 million or 68 cents a share a year ago
Revenue grew 13 % to 734.8 million from 650.9 million
The company said the growth was led by its major operations particularly mailing shipping dictating and facsimile businesses
Steel jackets of a type that may have prevented collapse of the columns of a 1.5-mile stretch of the Nimitz Freeway had been installed on at least a small test section of the double-decker highway last year by California 's Department of Transportation employees familiar with the project say
The test project which reportedly survived Tuesday 's earthquake was a prelude to a state plan to retrofit that critical section of the freeway with the steel casings
State engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns wrenched and separated from the double-decker roadbed that was responsible for the collapse
The failure in Oakland of the freeway segment known as the Cypress structure was the deadliest aspect of the quake although officials were hopeful yesterday that the death toll there might be significantly lower than the 250 initially feared
Sorting out the wreckage is expected to take several days
Red tractors gingerly picked at the rubble while jackhammers tried to break up some of the massive slabs of concrete
Giant yellow cranes were wheeled up alongside the collapsed segment preparing to lift off chunks of the debris
In Sacramento a transportation department spokesman said he could n't immediately confirm or deny existence of the test work
However he asserted that the department had n't mastered the technology needed to retrofit the entire Cypress structure
Moreover other officials noted snafus in transportation funding that the state has experienced over the years may have restricted the availability of funds for such a retrofitting even if it were technologically feasible
Knowledgeable employees said the retrofitting which had n't yet been budgeted was part of a planned three-stage reinforcement of the Cypress structure begun by the California transportation department several years ago
The Cypress reinforcement project itself was part of an annual effort to shore up structures believed vulnerable to earthquakes
The state began such work after a 1971 tremblor in Southern California when numerous bridges collapsed
We had just finished phase two of the Cypress project that involved installing a series of retaining cables designed to prevent sections of the roadway from separating as a result of seismic shock a state DOT engineer said
After completing installation of the jackets on one frame of the freeway last year the state DOT had sent the project over to its Sacramento engineers to draw up a final design
Knowledgeable employees said the project had been stymied somewhat by the difficulty of designing the jackets
The procedure involves encasing the concrete columns with steel then connecting them more securely to the double-decker roadbed
The employees also said the project may have been snagged by budgetary concerns
One preliminary estimate put the retrofitting cost at as much as 50 million
The collapse of the span has provoked surprise and anger among state officials
Gov. George Deukmejian who said he had been assured by state transportation officials that the structure could withstand an even larger quake called for an immediate investigation
I want to know who made the decision that it was safe for 186,000 people to use every day said Richard Katz a state legislator who is chairman of the California Assembly 's transportation committee
He said he would convene hearings within two weeks
The Cypress structure opened in June 1957 and as such like many buildings in the San Francisco Bay area does not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support
The northern piers of the span lie in estuarian deposits that were of a type to have liquefied easily during the 1906 quake
Transportation department officials however said they were as surprised as anyone by the Cypress destruction
They said previous earthquakes suggested that multiple-column viaducts would stand up well although they were working on ways to bolster them
Unfortunately there is only one laboratory for developing techniques to withstand earthquakes and that is an earthquake said Burch Bachtold San Francisco district director for the transportation department
He said We know of no technology that exists anywhere in the world that would allow us to reinforce the columns
Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara said it rescheduled to Nov. 29 a special shareholder meeting to vote on a 75 million stock-for-debt exchange
The meeting had been scheduled for Nov. 10 but the company delayed the meeting to allow time for the Securities and Exchange Commission to review the proposal
As part of a restructuring announced earlier this year the company proposed in August to exchange 168 newly issued common shares for each 1,000 face value of debt
However that figure could be revised Financial Corp. said
Currently the company has about six million common shares outstanding
If all the debt was converted about 13 million new shares would be issued
In composite trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange Financial Corp. closed at 1.125 unchanged
The debt consists of 50 million of 13 3\/8 % subordinated notes due 1998 and 25 million of 9 % convertible subordinated debentures due 2012
Financial Corp. also is proposing to exchange each of its 130,000 outstanding shares of cumulative convertible preferred series A stock for two shares of common
After years of quarreling over Bonn 's Ostpolitik West Germany and the U.S. appear to have shifted onto a united course in Eastern Europe
Bonn and Washington have taken a leading role in aid for the reformist countries pledging billions of dollars in fresh credit and forgiving old debt while urging other industrial nations to follow suit
Both hope to encourage pressure for change in East bloc countries still ruled by Stalinist holdouts by arranging liberal financial aid and trade benefits for Poland Hungary and to a lesser extent the Soviet Union
West German officials also have the special goal of holding out hope for East Germany 's fledgling reform movement
The change taking place in the Soviet Union Poland and Hungary has aroused new hope in both German states that reforms will be undertaken in East Germany and that relations between the two German states too will get better said Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
Addressing a conference of the New York-based Institute for East-West Security Studies in Frankfurt yesterday Mr. Genscher said History will judge us by whether we have taken the opportunities that emerge from these reforms
The ultimate aim of Western support for East bloc reforms he said is to create an equitable and stable peaceful order in Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals
Mr. Genscher and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher in separate speeches at the conference appealed for more Western contributions to economic reforms and business development in Hungary and Poland
Bonn and Washington are leading supporters of Poland 's request for a 1 billion stand-by credit from the International Monetary Fund
We want the bold programs of market development and political freedom in Hungary and in Poland to succeed
We are prepared to support those changes said Mr. Mosbacher
U.S. curbs on the exports of sensitive technology to East bloc countries will remain in place however
Meanwhile the U.S. House of Representatives yesterday approved an 837.5 million aid package for Poland and Hungary that more than doubles the amount President Bush had requested
The package was brought to the House just 15 days after it was introduced indicating Congress 's eagerness to reward Poland and Hungary for their moves toward democracy and freemarket economic reforms
The legislation approved 345-47 and sent to the Senate establishes two enterprise funds to be governed by independent nonprofit boards which will make loans and investments in new business ventures in Hungary and Poland
The Polish fund would be seeded with 160 million the Hungarian fund with 40 million
In addition a group of 24 industrialized countries including the U.S. and Japan and coordinated by the European Community Commission has promised Poland and Hungary trade advice and a line of credit equivalent to 1.11 billion through the European Investment Bank while the EC plans 222 million in direct aid
When Chancellor Helmut Kohl travels to Poland Nov. 9 he is expected to take with him a promise of three billion West German marks 1.6 billion in new credit guarantees for industrial projects
Last week Bonn agreed to reschedule 2.5 billion marks in Polish debt that came due last year
In addition a one billion mark credit dating from 1974 is to be written off
Poland 's plan to switch to a free-market economy by 1991 is hampered by a foreign debt load of 39.2 billion
West Germany also has increased its credit guarantees to Hungary by 500 million marks to 1.5 billion marks as the emerging democratic state rushes through its own economic reforms including a broad privatization of state-owned industry and tax incentives for industrial investment
An additional 500 million marks in credit-backing was promised by the West German state governments of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg
Deutsche Bank AG which last year arranged a three billion mark credit for the Soviet Union is now moving to become the first West German bank to set up independent business offices in Hungary and Poland as they shift to free-market economies
A maxim of Frankfurt banking holds that wherever Deutsche Bank goes other West German banks follow
Indeed at least four other West German banks are believed to be making inquiries
Mattel Inc. said third-quarter net income rose 73 % to 38 million or 76 cents a share from 21.9 million or 45 cents a share a year ago
Revenue rose 34 % to 410 million from 306.6 million a year earlier
Mattel 's world-wide volume has grown 25 % in a climate of relatively flat industry sales said John W. Amerman chairman
He said the toy company 's prospects for a strong fourth quarter are also good
Mattel attributed the jump in quarter net to strong world-wide sales of its Barbie doll Hot Wheels cars Disney toys and other well-known toy lines
The company also cited retail trade and consumer demand for new products introduced this year such as Cherry Merry Muffin and Turtle Tots
For the nine months Mattel net more than doubled to 58.9 million or 1.19 a share from 25.4 million or 53 cents a share a year ago
Revenue rose 25 % to 877.6 million from 702.4 million
Mattel said the company 's sale of rights to land and buildings at its Hawthorne Calif. headquarters resulted in a 13 million charge to third-quarter operating profit
The charge did n't affect net for the quarter as it was offset by tax benefits
Mattel has purchased a new headquarters building in El Segundo Calif. which it will occupy by the end of next year
Democracy can be cruel to politicians Sometimes it forces them to make choices
Now that the Supreme Court opened the door on the subject of abortion politicians are squinting under the glare of democratic choice
Their discomfort is a healthy sign for the rest of us
Republicans are squinting most painfully at least at first which is only fair because they 've been shielded the most
So long as abortion was a question for litigation not legislation Republicans could find political security in absolutism
They could attract one-issue voters by adopting the right-to-life movement 's strongest position even as pro-choice Republicans knew this mattered little on an issue monopolized by the court
Now it matters
Much of Washington thought it detected George Bush in a characteristic waffle on abortion the past week
Only a month ago he 'd warned Congress not to pass legislation to pay for abortions in cases of rape or incest
Last Friday after Congress passed it anyway he hinted he was looking for compromise
Was the man who once was pro-choice but later pro-life converting again In fact Mr. Bush 's dance was more wiggle than waffle
Pro-life advocates say the White House never wavered over the veto
Christopher Smith R. N.J. a pro-life leader in the House suggested a compromise that would have adapted restrictive language from rape and incest exceptions in the states
The White House never eager for a fight was happy to try which is why George Bush said he was looking for flexibility last week
When Democrats refused to budge pro-life Republicans met at the White House with Chief of Staff John Sununu on Monday and Mr. Bush quickly signaled a veto
Amid charges of timidity on Panama and elsewhere the president was n't about to offend his most energetic constituency
The GOP doubters were in Congress
In last week 's House vote 41 Republicans defected
After the vote Connecticut Rep. Nancy Johnson rounded up nearly as many signatures on a letter to Mr. Bush urging him not to veto
Even such a pro-life stalwart as Sen. Orrin Hatch R. Utah had counseled some kind of compromise
The Senate passed the same bill yesterday with a veto-proof majority of 67
The manuevering illustrates an emerging Republican donnybrook pacified since the early 1980s
At the 1988 GOP convention abortion was barely discussed at all though delegates were evenly divided on the question of an anti-abortion constitutional amendment
Ms. Johnson made a passionate statement to the platform committee but she was talking to herself
Now many Republicans are listening
They 're frightened by what they see in New Jersey and especially Virginia where pro-life GOP candidates for governor are being pummeled on abortion
Eddie Mahe a Republican consultant says the two GOP candidates could have avoided trouble if they had framed the issue first
In Virginia Marshall Coleman and his running mate Eddy Dalton are both on the defensive for opposing abortions even in cases of rape or incest
But Mr. Mahe adds The net loser in the next few years is the right-to-life side
Darla St. Martin of the National Right to Life Committee says exit polls from the 1988 election had single-issue pro-life voters giving Mr. Bush about five more percentage points of support than pro-choice voters gave Michael Dukakis
But the Supreme Court 's opening of debate may have changed even that
GOP pollster Neil Newhouse of the Wirthlin Group says polls this summer showed that the single-issue voters had about evened out
Polls are no substitute for principle but they 'll do for some politicians
The Republican danger is that abortion could become for them what it 's long been for Democrats a divisive litmus test
It 's already that in the Bush administration at least for any job in which abortion is even remotely an issue
Oklahoma official Robert Fulton lost a chance for a senior job in the Department of Health and Human Services after right-to-life activists opposed him
Caldwell Butler a conservative former congressman was barred from a Legal Services post after he gave wrong answers on abortion
Even the president 's doctor Burton Lee has said on the record that he 'd love to be surgeon general but could n't pass the pro-life test
In the case of HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan the litmus test could yet damage issues important to other parts of the Republican coalition
After Mr. Sullivan waffled on abortion last year the White House appeased right-to-lifers by surrounding him with pro-life deputies
Their views on health care and welfare did n't much matter though HHS spends billions a year on both
It makes only a handful of abortion-related decisions
Though Democrats can gloat at all this for now they may want to contain their glee
On abortion their own day will come
Eventually even Republicans will find a way to frame the issue in ways that expose pro-choice absolutism
Does the candidate favor parental consent for teen-age abortions The pro-choice lobby does n't
What about banning abortions in the second and third trimesters The lobby says no again
Democracy is forcing the abortion debate toward healthy compromise toward the unpolarizing middle
Roe v. Wade pre-empted political debate so the extremes blossomed
Now the ambivalent middle a moral majority of sorts is reasserting itself
Within a few years the outcome in most states is likely to be that abortion will be more restricted but not completely banned
This is where the voters are which is where politicians usually end up
Union Pacific Corp
third-quarter net income fell 17 %
Excluding earnings from discontinued operations a year earlier net fell only 2 %
The energy natural resources and railroad concern had net of 137.4 million or 1.35 a share down from 165 million or 1.44 a share a year earlier
In the 1988 third quarter profit from continuing operations totaled 140.1 million
A year earlier the company had profit from discontinued operations of 24.9 million from sale of a pipeline a refinery and an interest in a second refinery
Revenue rose 2 % to 1.58 billion from 1.54 billion
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Union Pacific jumped 1.375 to 75 a share
The company said its Union Pacific Railroad had a 3 % profit increase despite a 14 % rise in fuel costs and a 4 % drop in car loadings

The Federal Trade Commission ruled that five major title-insurance companies illegally fixed prices for title search-and-examination services by participating in joint rating bureaus in six states
The FTC ordered the companies not to use rating bureaus in those six states
The commission order named the following companies Ticor Title Insurance Co. of California a unit of Los Angeles-based Ticor Chicago Title Insurance Co. and Safeco Title Insurance Co. units of Chicago Title & Trust Co. Lawyers Title Insurance Corp. a unit of Richmond Va.-based Universal Corp. and Stewart Title Guaranty Co. a unit of Houston-based Stewart Information Services Corp
Chicago Title & Trust acquired Safeco in 1987 and changed the unit 's name to Security Union Title Insurance Co
The FTC ruled that the companies violated federal antitrust law by fixing rates in the following states New Jersey Pennsylvania Connecticut Wisconsin Arizona and Montana
The FTC first issued an administrative complaint in the case in 1985
John Christie a lawyer here for the two Chicago Title & Trust units accused the FTC of second-guessing state-level regulations with which he said his clients had complied
I expect all the companies to appeal he added
A lawyer for Lawyers Title said that because the named companies no longer use the type of cooperative rating bureaus attacked by the FTC the commission 's order wo n't have much practical impact
Officials for the other named companies did n't return telephone calls seeking comment

First they get us to buy computers so we can get more information
Then the computers give us more information than we can ever read
Now they plan to sell us products that sift through all the information to give us what we really want to know
The products range from computer-edited personal newsletters to systems that sit inside a personal computer and pick stories on selected topics off news wires
Filtered news is what people want says Esther Dyson editor of Release 1.0 an industry newsletter that spots new developments
Most people read 10 times more than necessary in order to find out what they really need
Geoffrey Goodfellow who dropped out of high school back in the 1970s to manage a computer network at a California research firm says Old network hands have started to turn off the network because they do n't have time to wade through the muck
Mr. Goodfellow has started a Menlo Park Calif. company called Anterior Technology that provides human editors for public electronic networks
I see it as a sewage treatment plant he says
A new product NewsEdge carries five business news wires simultaneously into a user 's computer and beeps and flashes whenever an article appears that is of interest to the user
The product developed by Desktop Data Corp. a new company based in Waltham Mass. scans the wires looking for articles that contain key words specified by the user
One early user David Semmel a Chicago venture capitalist and investor in Desktop Data says he uses it to track takeover developments
He says he told NewsEdge to look for stories containing such words as takeover acquisition acquire LBO tender merger junk and halted
I 'm pretty confident I 'm catching everything he says
NewsEdge is pricey 7,500 a year for a limited version 40,000 a year if the cost of all the news wires is included
And it works best in high-powered personal computers
But some investors and consultants who have tried it are enthusiastic
Jeffrey Tarter editor of SoftLetter a Watertown Mass. industry newsletter says I 've seen a lot of people fooling around on the fringes of filtering information
This is the first time I 've seen something I could imagine a lot of people using
NewsEdge uses an FM radio band to carry news wires provided by Reuters McGraw-Hill and Dow Jones & Co. as well as PR Newswire which carries corporate press releases
An FM receiver attached to a user 's personal computer receives the information
Some organizations have devised their own systems to sort through news wire items as they come in
George Goodwin an account manager at Royal Bank of Canada adapted a Lotus Development Corp. program called Agenda to sort through international news wires
It automatically selects stories from particular countries for reading by the international bankers responsible for lending in those areas
For those who do n't need their personalized information moment by moment some services are offering overnight newsletters
Individual Inc. a new company in Brookline Mass. uses filtering technology developed by Cornell University computer scientist Gerard Salton to automatically produce customized newsletters it sends electronically to subscribers by 8 a.m. the next day
We are operating an information refinery that takes a broad stream of raw data and turns it into actionable knowledge says Yosi Amram founder and president
The daily newsletter which is n't widely available yet will have a base cost of 2,000 a year and provides full text of relevant articles under license agreements with Reuters McGraw Hill United Press International two press release news wires and Japan 's Kyodo news service
One early user is NEC Corp. 's U.S. printer marketing arm
They want the full press releases on printer announcements by their competition Mr. Amram says
It also tracks personnel and financial announcements by NEC 's distributors and customers
Individual Inc. 's technology goes beyond word searches by using a computerized thesaurus
If a customer asks for stories about IBM the computer will also supply stories that mention I.B.M. International Business Machines or Big Blue Mr. Amram says
Moreover Individual Inc. 's computers can weigh the value of an article based on how closely the story matches the subscriber 's interest area
It compares the position of key words in the story words in the headline or first paragraph get a higher value
And it calculates how often the words appear in the story compared with how often they appear in the entire data base
The higher the ratio of hits to total words the higher the presumed value to the reader
Pinpoint Information Corp. Chantilly Va. a producer of 1,800-a-year personalized newsletters about the computer industry that started full operation last month relies on 12 human readers to code news releases by topic in order to select items for each subscriber
The computers find all the key words they can but the editors confirm every one
Computer picking is n't perfect says Harvey Golomb president and founder of Pinpoint
The humans also write abstracts of articles from some 200 computer industry publications
Once all the articles are coded and put in a data base Pinpoint 's computers pick the most relevant for each subscriber and lay them out in a three-to-five-page newsletter format each newsletter is sent directly from the computer to the subscriber 's fax machine
Mr. Golomb says each of his computers can produce and send about 75 unique newsletters a night
Many computer network users who never see news wires would like to sort through their electronic mail automatically
So-called E-mail is the collection of inter-office memos gossip technical data schedules and directives distributed over local and national computer networks
All these interconnected computers make it difficult to sort out what 's junk and what 's important says Chuck Digate a former Lotus Development executive who has started a new company to cope with the problem
Mr. Digate says his firm Beyond Inc. has licensed technology known as Information Lens from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and plans to develop it for commercial use
The MIT project devised ways for E-mail to be automatically categorized as top priority if it comes from certain designated senders or requires action in the next couple of days
Mr. Digate says that Beyond will refine the product so the message will be smart enough to know to come back and bother you again next week
And if a user is busy he can set it for crisis mode Do n't bother me with reports until Monday
A program called Notes which is under development by Lotus also is designed to sort E-mail sent within work groups
One thing that makes E-mail difficult to sift through is that each item looks the same
Notes which is designed for advanced computers that display graphics allows mail senders to put different logos on their mail
A daily news briefing from the company librarian for example would have a distinctive format on the screen just as a paper version would have
With E-mail you do n't have the visual clues of paper says Mr. Tarter the editor of SoftLetter
With Notes they 're visually distinct
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. lost its second recent arbitration case involving a former bond-trading executive
A New York Stock Exchange arbitration panel ordered Dean Witter to pay 404,294 in back bonuses to William Kelly the company 's former head of high-yield high-risk junk-bond trading and sales
It also awarded 196,785 in back bonuses to former trader Michael Newcomb and 69,105 in fees to the two men 's attorneys
The sums awarded to Messrs. Kelly and Newcomb represent bonuses the two men said they deserved from the first half of 1988 but which were n't paid because of a dispute over an incentive contract
Jeffrey L. Liddle the two men 's attorney at Liddle O'Connor Finkelstein & Robinson said Mr. Kelly began working at Dean Witter in 1987
Mr. Kelly built the company 's high-yield bond group which has been a minor player in the junk-bond arena
Dean Witter lost a separate case involving a former bond executive earlier this year in August it paid 666,666 in back pay and a bonus to a former corporate-bond trading chief Harold Bachman
That award ended a dispute between Dean Witter and Mr. Bachman over who was responsible for certain bond-trading losses around the time of the 1987 stock-market crash
A spokesman for Dean Witter a unit of Sears Roebuck & Co. declined to comment

WASHINGTON LIES LOW after the stock market 's roller-coaster ride
Lawmakers haunted by charges that some of their comments contributed to the 1987 crash generally shy away from calls for sweeping new legislation
But a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee will quiz SEC Chairman Breeden Wednesday and Treasury Secretary Brady will go before the Senate Banking panel Thursday
The market 's wild week may speed along the market-reform legislation that has been pending for months in the aftermath of the 1987 crash
It may also expedite the SEC 's modest pending changes in junk-bond disclosure rules and intensify the Treasury 's look at plans for giving new tax breaks on dividends and raising taxes on short-term trades by pension funds
Brady and Breeden work well together on the plunge despite the fact that the Treasury secretary opposed Breeden 's nomination to the SEC post

Ever since the hotly contested America 's Cup race last year the famous yachting match has run into more rough sailing out of the water than in it
Now that a key member of the San Diego Yacht Club team is splitting off to form his own team even more competition lies ahead
Peter Isler the winning navigator in the past two America 's Cup challenges has split from the team led by Dennis Conner skipper of the victorious Stars & Stripes to form his own team for the next contest in 1992
And in addition to a crack team of sailors Mr. Isler has lined up some real brass to help him finance the syndicate
Isler Sailing International 's advisory board includes Ted Turner Turner Broadcasting chairman and a former Cup victor Peter G. Diamandis head of Diamandis Communications and Joseph B. Vittoria chairman and chief executive of Avis Inc
His steering committee includes other notable businessmen including the California investor and old salt Roy E. Disney
We have the structure people and plan Mr. Isler said in a statement
Now the first order of business is raising enough money to keep his team afloat a new yacht will cost about 3 million alone and sailing syndicate budgets can easily run to 25 million for a Cup challenge
The split comes in the midst of a court battle over whether the San Diego Yacht Club should be allowed to keep the international trophy for sailing a catamaran against the New Zealand challengers ' 90-foot monohull
In September a New York appellate court overturned a state judge 's ruling that awarded the Cup to the New Zealand team
Pending an appeal by the New Zealand team led by Michael Fay the finals for the next Cup challenge are scheduled to be held in mid-1992 in San Diego
But because of the uncertainty of the outcome of the suit Mr. Conner 's team has done little to begin gearing up to defend its title
If you do n't know what the rules of the game are it 's hard to start your fund-raising or design said Dana Smith an official with Team Dennis Conner
The Conner team wo n't be able to negotiate with corporate sponsors until the suit is resolved and the race site is determined Mr. Smith said and the syndicate 's budget could easily reach 30 million
But spokesmen for both Mr. Isler and Mr. Conner say the formation of the new syndicate has to do with Mr. Isler 's desire to skipper his own team and begin planning now rather than any falling out between the two sportsmen
Mr. Smith and a spokesman for the America 's Cup Organizing Committee insist that the added competition for the defender 's spot will only improve the race
Missouri farmer Blake Hurst writing in the fall issue of the Heritage Foundation 's Policy Review about the proposed location of a hazardous-waste incinerator in his county Of course I 'd rather have a computer software firm in my backyard than a hazardous waste incinerator
But I 'd also rather live next door to an incinerator than to some of the hog farms I 've seen and smelt in these parts
An incinerator is also probably better than having nobody next door on our farm there are four unoccupied houses
On my four-mile drive to farm headquarters each morning I drive by another four empty houses
A community of abandoned farmsteads failing businesses and crumbling roads and bridges is hardly a desirable one
The loss of 40 jobs by a depressed county in rural Missouri is hardly of national importance except for this If the most environmentally safe way of dealing with a national problem can not be built in Atchinson County what hope have we for dealing with the wastes our economy produces After all farmers here work with hazardous chemicals every day many of them the same chemicals that would have been destroyed in the incinerator
We know they are dangerous but if handled with care their benefits far outweigh any risk to the environment
Just because Stamford Conn. High School did nothing when its valuable 1930s mural was thrown in the trash does n't mean the city no longer owns the work of art a federal judge ruled
The mural now valued at 1.3 million according to appraisers was tossed in a trash heap in 1971 by workers who were renovating the building
The 100-foot-long mural painted by James Daugherty in 1934 was commissioned by the federal Works Project Administration
After the discarded mural was found outside the school by a concerned Stamford graduate it eventually was turned over to Hiram Hoelzer a professional art restorer
Throughout the 1970s Stamford school and city officials made no effort to locate the mural
Apparently the officials did n't even know the mural was missing until 1980 when a researcher found that the painting was in Mr. Hoelzer 's studio and questioned school officials about it
In 1986 Stamford officials thanked Mr. Hoelzer for taking care of the mural and demanded he return it as soon as possible
Mr. Hoelzer however sued Stamford claiming that the city had abandoned the artwork and that it had waited too long to reclaim it
But Judge Louis L. Stanton of federal court in Manhattan ruled that the city could n't be faulted for waiting too long because it did n't realize until 1986 that its ownership of the painting was in dispute
The judge also ruled that the painting was n't abandoned because officials did n't intend for it to be thrown away and were unaware that the workmen had discarded it
Mr. Hoelzer did n't return phone calls seeking comment on the judge 's decision
The judge ordered that a hearing be held Nov. 17 to determine how much the city should pay Mr. Hoelzer for his services
Mary E. Sommer corporate counsel for Stamford said the city has discussed several possible plans for displaying the mural which portrays various scenes from the Great Depression
She said the mural preserves an era in Stamford and in our country when this type of work was being done
The prices of corn futures contracts jumped amid rumors that the Soviet Union is keeping up its dizzying October buying binge of U.S. corn
Those rumors were confirmed after the end of trading yesterday when the U.S. Agriculture Department announced that the Soviets had bought 1.2 million metric tons of U.S. corn bringing their U.S. corn purchases confirmed so far this month to about five million metric tons
In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade the corn contract for December delivery jumped 5.75 cents a bushel to settle at 2.44 a bushel
The Soviet purchases are close to exceeding what some analysts had expected the Soviet Union to buy this fall the season in which it usually buys much of the corn it imports from the U.S.
That pace is causing some analysts to speculate that the Soviet Union might soon purchase as much as another two million metric tons
One sign that more Soviet purchases are possible is that U.S. grain companies yesterday bought an unusually large amount of corn futures contracts
That sometimes signals that they are laying plans to export corn
By some estimates several grain companies combined bought contracts for the possession of roughly one million metric tons of corn
By buying futures contracts these companies attempt to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they are obligated to deliver
Rumors of Soviet interest also pushed up the prices of soybean futures contracts
Among other things the Agriculture Department is widely thought to be mulling whether to subsidize the sale of soybean oil to the Soviet Union
On top of all this corn and soybean prices rose on reports that the Midwest harvest was disrupted by a freakishly early snow storm that dumped several inches in parts of Indiana and Ohio
The harvest delays however are expected to be temporary
Balmy temperatures are forecast for next week said Robert Lekberg an analyst at Farmers Grain & Livestock Corp. Chicago
Many farmers used the jump in prices to sell their recently harvested crop to grain elevator companies
The heavy selling by farmers helped to damp the price rally
Wheat futures prices rose slightly
In other commodity markets yesterday PRECIOUS METALS Futures prices declined
A number of developments were negatively interpreted by traders
December delivery gold fell 1.80 an ounce to 370.60
December silver eased 2.7 cents an ounce to 5.133
January platinum was down 3.60 an ounce at 491.10
One price-depressing development was the lower-than-expected increase of only 0.2 % in the consumer price index for September an analyst said
He noted that the core inflation rate which excludes food and energy was also low at 0.2 %
Other news that weighed on the market Initial unemployment claims rose by 62,000 last week American Telephone & Telegraph Co. will reduce its managerial staff by 15,000 through attrition the oil market turned weaker there was n't any investor demand for bullion and the dollar strengthened during the day putting pressure on gold
Also the analyst said economic circumstances are such that both South Africa and the Soviet Union the principal gold and platinum producers are being forced to continue selling the metals
Both are in great need of foreign exchange and South Africa is also under pressure to meet foreign loan commitments he said
Putting it all together we have a negative scenario that does n't look like it will improve overnight he said
COPPER Futures prices recovered in quiet trading
The December contract rose 1.50 cents a pound to 1.2795
That contract fell a total of 5.75 cents during the first three days of this week mostly in reaction to last Friday 's stock market plunge which prompted concern that it might signal a similar sharp slowing of the U.S. economy and thus reduced demand for copper a leading industrial metal
In recent days however there has been increased purchasing of copper in London an analyst said
Some of this buying was by Japan which has had its supplies sharply reduced by long production stoppages at the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea Highland Valley mine in British Columbia and the Cananea mine in Mexico which are major shippers to Japan
The increasing likelihood that Cananea and Highland Valley will soon return to production may have cut some of that purchasing but even if any of these mines begin operating soon their output wo n't be significant until at least the end of the year analysts note
So one analyst said even though the long-term production problems may be easing there will still be a significant need for copper over the next three months when inventories will remain relatively low
ENERGY Crude oil prices ended mixed
West Texas Intermediate for November delivery fell 14 cents a barrel to 20.42

But a flurry of late trading yesterday beefed up prices

In the first 25 minutes after his office 's telephone service was restored yesterday morning 17 potential clients had called seeking the services of the self-proclaimed King of Torts
Mr. Belli like many other personal-injury lawyers suspects that the earthquake which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale will generate enough lawsuits to keep this city 's personal-injury and construction lawyers busy for quite some time
Suits are likely to be filed against engineering firms contractors and developers as well as against local-government agencies
But lawyers looking to cash in on the quake may have a tough time once their cases reach a judge
Experts on California tort law say protections afforded government agencies in such cases are pretty ironclad
Even claims against individuals and companies face significant roadblocks
The major legal barrier is the principle that no one can be held liable for an act of God
For now says Laurence Drivon president-elect of the 6,000-member California Trial Lawyers Association the last thing we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued or whether they have liability or not
We still have people wandering around in a daze in San Francisco worrying about whether it 's going to rain tonight
But that wo n't stop plaintiffs ' lawyers from seeking a little room for maneuvering
In San Francisco they argue an earthquake was a near certainty
Therefore engineering firms construction contractors and developers can be sued for not keeping structures up to standard and government agencies can be held accountable for failing to properly protect citizens from such a foreseeable disaster if negligence can be proven
My prediction is there will be mass litigation over errors and omissions in engineering and contracting says Stanley Chesley a well-known Cincinnati plaintiffs lawyer
From what he saw on television Mr. Chesley points out that Interstate 880 which collapsed and killed more than 200 commuters suffered serious damage while surrounding buildings appeared to sustain no damage whatsoever
He adds that they were aware of the propensity for earthquakes and the San Andreas Fault
The flamboyant and publicity-conscious Mr. Belli says he already has investigators looking into who could be held liable for the damage on the Bay Bridge and the interstate approaching it
We wo n't know until the smoke clears but yes we 're looking into it he says
Mr. Belli says he wants to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have prevented the damage
Mr. Belli who was at Candlestick Park for the World Series Tuesday night says he has hired civil engineers to check out his own mildly damaged building and to investigate the bridge collapse
Defense lawyers perhaps understandably say that plaintiffs ' lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at individually
A lot of this is going to be code-related says Ignazio J. Ruvolo a construction law specialist at Bronson Bronson & McKinnon a San Francisco law firm
Plaintiffs he says will argue that damaged structures were n't built to proper design standards
But if defendants can prove that they met San Francisco 's stringent building codes that 's probably going to protect them Mr. Ruvolo says
Government entities continues Mr. Ruvolo could be protected by the California Government Tort Liability Act
Under the statute agencies are provided defenses that normally are n't available in the private sector Mr. Ruvolo says
The legislature does not want to inhibit the unique government activities by exposing public entities to liability
Built into the statute are so-called design immunities which are likely to protect government agencies according to Mr. Ruvolo and Richard Covert a lawyer with the California Department of Transportation which oversees the damaged Bay Bridge
The state is protected when plans and designs for public structures were approved ahead of time or when structures met previously approved standards says Mr. Covert
He believes those defenses might well apply to the Bay Bridge collapse
Nevertheless he adds I would n't get totally shocked if we get lawsuits out of the Bay Bridge
If there 's going to be a race to the courthouse it has n't started yet
Mr. Covert had to search through law books scattered on the floor of his office yesterday and Mr. Belli 's courtyard was strewn with bricks
Wednesday Mr. Belli 's staff was n't permitted into his office by city officials worried about their safety
He said he set up shop on the sidewalk in front of his town-house office and helped victims apply for federal aid free of charge
In a news release issued by Mr. Drivon the trial lawyers association also promised free assistance to victims
The association said it would monitor the conduct of lawyers and warned that solicitation of business is unethical
What 's in a name Apparently a lot according to the British firm of Deloitte Haskins & Sells
The British firm has begun court proceedings in London to prevent the use of the name Deloitte by Deloitte Haskins & Sells and Touche Ross & Co. in England and the rest of the world
The British Deloitte firm recently withdrew from the merger of Deloitte and Touche world-wide and joined Coopers & Lybrand
John Bullock senior partner of Deloitte in the U.K. said the decision to start these proceedings has n't been taken lightly
Mr. Bullock said the British firm has used the name Deloitte since 1845
In the U.S. Deloitte Haskins & Sells was known as Haskins & Sells until 1978 when it added the Deloitte name of its British affiliate
John C. Burton an accounting professor at Columbia University 's Graduate School of Business said there 's a lot of emotion involved in the name of an accounting firm with a long history and with roots in England where accounting predates the U.S.
Although accountants are n't noted as being deeply emotional they really hold it all in said Mr. Burton former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission
J. Michael Cook chairman of Deloitte Haskins & Sells International said he believes the legal action by the British firm to be without merit
Mr. Cook said that last June the international executive committes of Deloitte and Touche agreed to a world-wide merger
The merger is proceeding according to plan except as to the withdrawal of the Deloitte U.K. firm he said
Partners at other accounting firms say that the Deloitte firm in the U.K. is filing the suit to get even with the merged Deloitte-Touche firm for keeping major auditing work in England
General Motors Corp. a Deloitte audit client for example has agreed to keep its annual 18 million world-wide audit and associated tax work with the merged Deloitte-Touche firm to be known as Deloitte & Touche in the U.S.
In England this would mean that the British Deloitte would lose revenue for its audit of GM 's Vauxhill unit
The defection of Deloitte 's affiliates in Britain and the Netherlands to Coopers & Lybrand will make Coopers one of the biggest accounting firms in Europe rivaling KPMG Peat Marwick there
Although Coopers has n't been courted by other major accounting firms for a merger it is benefiting greatly from fallout from the Deloitte-Touche merger
In New York Harris Amhowitz general counsel of Coopers said Coopers was aware of the litigation but he declined further comment
He also declined to comment on the name that Coopers would use in England if Deloitte UK won its litigation to keep its name
Coopers uses the Coopers & Lybrand name world-wide
William Bennett the White House drug-policy director accused local officials in the Washington area of blocking construction of prison facilities to house convicted drug dealers
Politics has essentially put up a roadblock to finding sites for new federal prisons Mr. Bennett said at a news conference called to report on his emergency assistance program for the capital
Without more space to incarcerate convicted criminals he added we will not win the war on drugs
Mr. Bennett declared in April that he would make Washington a test case for how the Bush administration would aid cities afflicted by heavy drug trafficking and violence
The drug czar claimed that enforcement efforts are working here albeit at a slower and more halting pace than we would like
He acknowledged however that Washington 's drug-related murder rate is intolerably high
The prisons are too crowded
Drugs continue to be sold openly around schools parks and housing projects
Mr. Bennett declined to name the area officials who he believes have impeded plans for building more federal prisons to ease Washington 's problem
But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for blocking the use of possible sites in that state
Administration officials also have said that Washington Mayor Marion Barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city
In a letter to Mr. Bennett 's office released yesterday Washington 's city administrator Carol Thompson complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the capital
Referring to Mr. Bennett 's claim that the federal government would provide 97 million in emergency federal support Ms. Thompson wrote Our analysis was unable to even come close to documenting that figure
Of his successes in Washington Mr. Bennett stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of 375 local inmates
He also noted that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration has established a federal-local task force responsible since April for 106 arrests and more than 2 million in seizures of drug dealers ' assets
The Defense Department has lent the Washington U.S. attorney 10 prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has provided crime laboratory facilities and training he added
What if it happened to us In the wake of the earthquake in California and the devastation of Hurricane Hugo many companies in disaster-prone areas are pondering the question of preparedness
Some particularly in West Coast earthquake zones are dusting off their evacuation plans checking food stocks and reminding employees of what to do if emergency strikes
Others say they feel confident that steps they 've already taken would see them through a disaster
Preparedness involves more than flashlights and fire alarms these days
Some big companies have teams of in-house experts focusing on safety and business resumption
Many companies in the path of potential disaster have set up contingency offices in safe regions hoping they can transport employees there and resume operations quickly
That means making sure that copies of vital computer software and company records are out of harm 's way
Some businesses like Disneyland claim that even if they became isolated in a crisis they would be able to feed and care for their people for as long as five days
Self-sufficiency has to be the cornerstone of your plan says Stephanie Masaki-Schatz manager of corporate emergency planning at Atlantic Richfield Co. in Los Angeles
If you do n't save your critical people you wo n't be able to bring up your vital business functions
Although ARCO 's head office more than 300 miles from the epicenter was n't affected by this week 's tremors Ms. Masaki-Schatz used the occasion to distribute a three-page memo of Earthquake Tips to 1,200 ARCO employees
You need to capitalize on these moments when you have everyone 's attention she says
It was a good reminder that we all need to prepare prior to an event
The ARCO memo urges employees to keep certain supplies at work such as solid shoes and heavy gloves to clear debris
It also recommends that employees be aware of everyday office items that could be used for emergency care or shelter
Among the suggestions Pantyhose and men 's ties could be used for slings while removable wooden shelves might aid in breaking through office walls
ARCO maintains an office in Dallas that would take over if payroll operations in Pasadena were disrupted
Two months ago the company set up a toll-free number based outside California to handle queries from employees about when they should report back to work after an earthquake or other disaster
The ARCO plan takes into account such details as which aspects of business are busier at certain times of the year
This way depending on when a quake might strike priorities can be assigned to departments that should be brought back on line first
At Hewlett-Packard Co. the earthquake came just as the company was reviewing its own emergency procedures
We were talking about scheduling a practice drill for November says Joan Tharp a spokeswoman
Then we had a real one in the afternoon
The Palo Alto Calif. computer maker scrambled to set up a special phone line to tell manufacturing and support staff to stay home Wednesday
Sales and service employees were asked to report to work to help Bay area clients who called with computer problems
Hewlett-Packard also called in its systems experts to restore its own computer operations
That means we can accept orders and begin getting back to normal says Ms. Tharp
Prompted by an earlier California earthquake as well as a fire in a Los Angeles office tower Great Western Bank in the past year hired three emergency planners and spent 75,000 equipping a trailer with communications gear to serve as an emergency headquarters
Although officials of the savings and loan a unit of Great Western Financial Corp. used some of their new plans and equipment during this week 's quake they still lost touch for more than 24 hours with 15 branches in the affected areas not knowing if employees were injured or vaults were broken open
Some people flat out did n't know what to do says Robert G. Lee vice president for emergency planning and corporate security at Great Western
As it turned out bank employees were n't hurt and the vaults withstood the jolts
Still says Mr. Lee We need to educate people that they need to get to a phone somehow some way to let someone know what their status is
Some companies are confident that they 're prepared
Occidental Petroleum Corp. holds regular evacuation drills and stocks food oxygen and non-prescription drugs at checkpoints in its 16-story headquarters
The company also maintains rechargeable flashlights in offices and changes its standby supply of drinking water every three months
We feel we are doing everything we can an Occidental spokesman says
Walt Disney Co. 's Disneyland in Anaheim Calif. stocks rescue equipment medical supplies and enough food and water to feed at least 10,000 visitors for as long as five days in the event that a calamity isolates the theme park
The park also has emergency centers where specially trained employees would go to coordinate evacuation and rescue plans using walkie-talkies cellular phones and a public-address system
The centers are complete with maps detailing utility lines beneath rides and safe havens where people can be assembled away from major structures
Vista Chemical Co. with three chemical plants in and near Lake Charles La. prepares for every hurricane that enters the Gulf of Mexico says Keith L. Fogg a company safety director
Hurricane Hugo an Atlantic storm did n't affect Vista
But two other major storms have threatened operations so far this year most recently Hurricane Jerry this week
Because hurricanes can change course rapidly the company sends employees home and shuts down operations in stages the closer a storm gets the more complete the shutdown
The company does n't wait until the final hours to get ready for hurricanes
There are just tons of things that have to be considered Mr. Fogg says
Empty tank cars will float away on you if you get a big tidal surge
Still Vista officials realize they 're relatively fortunate
With a hurricane you know it 's coming
You have time to put precautionary mechanisms in place notes a Vista spokeswoman
A situation like San Francisco is so frightening because there 's no warning
Former Democratic fund-raiser Thomas M. Gaubert whose savings and loan was wrested from his control by federal thrift regulators has been granted court permission to sue the regulators
In a ruling by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans Mr. Gaubert received the go-ahead to pursue a claim against the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas for losses he suffered when the Bank Board closed the Independent American Savings Association of Irving Texas
Mr. Gaubert who was chairman and the majority stockholder of Independent American had relinquished his control in exchange for federal regulators ' agreement to drop their inquiry into his activities at another savings and loan
As part of the agreement Mr. Gaubert contributed real estate valued at 25 million to the assets of Independent American
While under the control of federal regulators Independent American 's net worth dropped from 75 million to a negative 400 million wiping out the value of Mr. Gaubert 's real estate contribution and his stock in the institution
Mr. Gaubert 's suit to recover his damages was dismissed last year by U.S. District Judge Robert Maloney of Dallas under the Federal Tort Claims Act which offers broad protection for actions by federal agencies and employees
Earlier this week a Fifth Circuit appellate panel upheld Judge Maloney 's dismissal of Mr. Gaubert 's claim as a shareholder but said the judge should reconsider Mr. Gaubert 's claim for the loss of his property
It may depend on whether there was an express or implied promise that the federal officials would not negligently cause the deterioration of Independent American the court wrote
Mr. Gaubert 's lawyer Abbe David Lowell of Washington D.C. says the impact of the ruling on other cases involving thrift takeovers will depend on the degree of similarity in the facts
I do n't know if this will affect one institution or a hundred Mr. Lowell says
It does establish a very clear precedent for suing the FHLBB where there was none before
MAITRE'D CLAIMS in suit that restaurant fired her because she was pregnant
In a suit filed in state court in Manhattan the American Civil Liberties Union is representing the former maitre 'd of the chic Odeon restaurant
The suit which seeks compensatory and punitive damages of 1 million alleges that the firing of Marcia Trees Levine violated New York state 's human-rights law
Among other things the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy
The suit alleges that Ms. Levine was fired after she refused to accept a lower paying less visible job upon reaching her sixth month of pregnancy
Ms. Levine told her employer that she was pregnant in February a month later the suit says the restaurant manager told Ms. Levine that she would be demoted to his assistant because he felt customers would be uncomfortable with a pregnant maitre 'd
Kary Moss an attorney with the ACLU 's Women 's Rights Project said They wanted a svelte-looking woman and a pregnant woman is not svelte
They told her We do n't hire fat people and we do n't hire cripples
And pregnant women are fat
Ms. Moss said Ms. Levine secretly taped many conversations with her bosses at the Odeon in which they told her she was being fired as maitre 'd because she was pregnant
Paul H. Aloe an attorney for Odeon owner Keith McNally denied the allegations
He said Ms. Levine had never been fired although she had stopped working at the restaurant
The Odeon made a written offer to Marcia Levine on July 10 to return to work as the maitre 'd at the same pay same hours and with back pay accrued he said
Mr. Aloe said the Odeon has no policy against hiring pregnant people
LAWYERS IN Texas 's biggest bank-fraud case want out in face of retrial
Lawyers representing five of the seven defendants in the case say their clients can no longer afford their services
The trial of the case lasted seven months and ended in September with a hung jury
The defendants were indicted two years ago on charges that they conspired to defraud five thrifts of more than 130 million through a complicated scheme to inflate the price of land and condominium construction along Interstate 30 east of Dallas
The defense lawyers three of whom are solo practitioners say they ca n't afford to put their law practices on hold for another seven-month trial
Some of the lawyers say they would continue to represent their clients if the government pays their tab as court-appointed lawyers
Assistant U.S. Attorney Terry Hart of Dallas says the government will oppose any efforts to bring in a new defense team because it would delay a retrial
FEDERAL JUDGE ALCEE HASTINGS of Florida facing impeachment received an unanticipated boost yesterday
Sen. Arlen Specter R. Pa
urged acquittal of the judge in a brief circulated to his Senate colleagues during closed-door deliberations
Among other things the brief cited insufficient evidence
Sen. Specter was vice chairman of the impeachment trial committee that heard evidence in the Hastings case last summer
A former prosecutor and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Sen. Specter is expected to exercise influence when the Senate votes on the impeachment today

New York Times Co. 's third-quarter earnings report is reinforcing analysts ' belief that newspaper publishers will be facing continued poor earnings comparisons through 1990
The publisher was able to register soaring quarter net income because of a onetime gain on the sale of its cable-TV system
However operating profit fell 35 % to 16.4 million
The decline reflected the expense of buying three magazines lower earnings from the forest-products group and what is proving to be a nagging major problem continued declines in advertising linage at the New York Times the company 's flagship daily newspaper
In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange New York Times closed at 28.125 a share down 37.5 cents
Analysts said the company 's troubles mirror those of the industry
Retail advertising which often represents half of the advertising volume at most daily newspapers largely is n't rebounding in the second half from extended doldrums as expected
At the same time newspapers are bedeviled by lagging national advertising especially in its financial component
Dow Jones & Co. recently reported net fell 9.9 % a reflection in part of continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron 's magazine
We expect next year to be a fairly soft year in newspaper-industry advertising said John Morton an analyst for Lynch Jones & Ryan
Next year earnings will hold steady but we just do n't see a big turnaround in the trend in advertising
John S. Reidy an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said The Times faces the same problem of other publishers linage is down
It will be hard to do handstands until real linage starts heading back up
In the quarterly report Arthur Ochs Sulzberger New York Times Co. chairman and chief executive officer said negative factors affecting third-quarter earnings will continue
Analysts agreed with company expectations that operating profit will be down this year and in 1990
Mr. Sulzberger said the scheduled opening of a new color-printing plant in Edison N.J. in 1990 would involve heavy startup and depreciation costs
With the Edison plant coming on line next summer the Times is facing some tough earnings comparison in the future said Peter Appert an analyst with C.J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell
But many newspapers are facing similar comparisons
The sale of the company 's cable franchise brought an after-tax gain of 193.3 million part of which will be used to reduce debt
The company also has a stock-repurchase plan
Analysts said they were impressed by the performance of the company 's newspaper group which consists of the Times 35 regional newspapers and a one-third interest in the International Herald Tribune group operating profit for the quarter increased slightly to 34.9 million from 34.5 million on flat revenue
Drexel Burnham 's Mr. Reidy pointed out that profits held up in a tough revenue environment
That 's a good sign when profits are stable during a time revenue is in the trough
Investors celebrated the second anniversary of Black Monday with a buying spree in both stocks and bonds
But the dollar was mixed
Stock and bond investors were cheered by last month 's encouragingly low inflation rate
This news raised hopes for further interest-rate cuts
Treasury-bond prices immediately rallied setting the stock market rolling from the opening bell
The Dow Jones Industrial Average up about 60 points in mid-afternoon finished with a gain of 39.55 points to 2683.20
That brought the average 's cumulative gain this week to about 114 points
Since the 1987 crash the industrials have soared more than 54 % and the widely watched market barometer is about 4 % below its record high set earlier this month
The stock-market rally was led by blue-chip issues but unlike Monday 's rebound was broadly based
Indeed over-the-counter stocks led by technology issues outleaped the industrial average
The Nasdaq Composite Index soared 7.52 or 1.6 % to 470.80 its highest one-day jump in points this year
Many takeover-related stocks rose after news that a group obtained financing commitments for the proposed buy-out of American Medical International Inc
Among the biggest winners were brokerage-house stocks responding to heavy trading volume
The government said consumer prices rose only 0.2 % last month
Economists expected twice as large an increase
That news plus recent signs of economic sluggishness greatly increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease credit further which in turn would be good news for stocks investment managers say
I see a lot of evidence indicating a slower economy and that means my interest-rate outlook has a downward tilt said Garnett L. Keith Jr. vice chairman of Prudential Insurance Co. of America one of the nation 's largest institutional investors
Fed officials probably wo n't drive down rates immediately Mr. Keith said
Despite the inflation news several Fed officials still fear consumer-price pressures will intensify because they insist the economy is stronger than generally believed
But Wall Street analysts expect further signs of economic weakness in government reports during the next few weeks
If so that will cinch the case for another shot of credit-easing within a month or so
That in turn is expected to persuade banks to cut their prime lending rate a benchmark rate on many corporate and consumer loans by half a percentage point to 10 %
We 're not out of the woods yet by any means said George R. Mateyo president and chief executive of Carnegie Capital Management Co. Cleveland
But the economy is slowing enough to give the Federal Reserve leeway to reduce interest rates
But many individual investors are leery about stocks because of fresh signs of fragility in the huge junk-bond market
Investors also are anxious about today 's witching hour the monthly expiration of stock-index futures and options and options on individual stocks
This phenomenon often makes stock prices swing wildly at the end of the trading session
In major market activity Stock prices surged in heavy trading
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange rose to 198.1 million shares from 166.9 million Wednesday
Gaining Big Board issues outnumbered decliners by 1,235 to 355
The dollar was mixed
In New York late yesterday it was at 141.70 yen up from 141.45 yen late Wednesday
But it fell to 1.8470 marks from 1.8485
Tuesday 's rout of a GOP congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that has n't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson is another reminder that at least at the federal level political ticket splitting has been on the rise over the past half century
In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20 % of the nation 's congressional districts choose a different party 's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives
Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40 %
As we know voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for president than in those for Congress
In every presidential election over the past half century except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress
Prior to 1932 the pattern was nearly the opposite
What accounts for the results of recent decades A simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth
The theory relies on three assumptions 1 Voters can buy one of two brands when they select their political agents a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest
2 Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office dealing with national issues programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and\/or confers benefits on the population at large and attending to local issues constituency service and pork barrel
3 Republican congressional representatives because of their belief in a minimalist state are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are Democratic members of Congress
If these assumptions hold voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner 's dilemma and have an incentive at the margin to lean Democratic
If they put a Republican into office not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from bringing home the bacon to their respective constituencies
Each legislator after all is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making
In races for the White House a voter 's incentive at the margin is to lean Republican
Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter 's particular district\/state such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts\/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits
The individual voter 's standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes
While this theory is exceedingly simple it appears to explain several things
First why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe
Second it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency
Third the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office
For example first-term members of the House once the most vulnerable of incumbents have become virtually immune to defeat
The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982
Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role spreading the Reagan revolution in national policy making they were more vulnerable to defeat
Fourth the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office
Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent
To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner 's dilemma game works to their disadvantage the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates
Fifth the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South
To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office
Finally the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House
Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts
Is there any empirical support for this theory Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues
First economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do
To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns
Second if the key assumption is valid Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking
This is indeed what the data indicate particularly in the case of the House
The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959
Finally as shown in the table Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices
An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 when control of that body changed party hands moreover reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise due to their majority-party status over other resources such as committee staff
An additional piece of evidence from the Senate Holding other factors constant such as incumbency advantages and regional factors the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder
Put more simply GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe
Moreover ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level
State government is more typically split along Republican-governor\/Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse
A cross-state econometric investigation furthermore reveals that holding other factors constant the difference between a state 's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate
In sum at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation
Mr. Zupan teaches at the University of Southern California 's business school
A House-Senate conference approved a nearly 17 billion State Justice and Commerce Department bill that makes federal reparations for Japanese-Americans held in World War II internment camps a legal entitlement after next Oct. 1
The measure provides no money for the promised payments until then but beginning in fiscal 1991 the government would be committed to meeting annual payments of as much as 500 million until the total liability of approximately 1.25 billion is paid
The action abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts to fund the payments but is widely seen as a more realistic means of expediting reparations first authorized in 1988
The action came as Congress sent to President Bush a fiscal 1990 bill providing an estimated 156.7 billion for the Departments of Labor Education Health and Human Services
Final approval was on a 67-31 roll call in the Senate which sets the stage for a veto confrontation with Mr. Bush over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor women
Reversing an eight-year federal policy the measure supports Medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest but Mr. Bush has so far refused to support any specific exemption beyond instances in which the mother 's life is in danger
Mr. Bush 's veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided House but a vote to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill
The measure before the conference yesterday funds the Departments of State Justice and Commerce through fiscal 1990
An estimated 1.32 billion is provided for next year 's census and negotiators stripped a Senate-passed rider seeking to block the counting of illegal aliens
Elsewhere in the Commerce Department nearly 191.2 million is preserved for assistance programs under the Economic Development Administration
And in a footnote to the fall of House Speaker James Wright this year the conference voted to rescind 11.8 million in unspent EDA funds for a Fort Worth Texas stockyards project that figured in ethics charges against the former Democratic leader
Fiscal pressures also forced the adoption of new fees charged by federal agencies and an 18 % increase in the Securities and Exchange Commission 's budget would be financed entirely by an added 26 million in filing fees
In an unprecedented step the measure anticipates another 30 million in receipts by having the Federal Bureau of Investigation charge for fingerprint services in civil cases a change that is almost certain to increase Pentagon costs in processing personnel and security clearances
The bill does n't include an estimated 1.9 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds for Justice Department and law-enforcement accounts that are still in conference with the House
But yesterday 's agreement would make it easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled 50 % increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants
Similarly the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as New Hampshire and Delaware a minimum allocation of 1.6 million each in drug grants or three times the current minimum
The odd mix of departments in the bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from 1.5 million for a fish farm in Arkansas to a music festival in Moscow under the United States Information Agency
Lawmakers scrapped all of a 7.4 million State Department request for the 1992 Expo in Seville Spain but agreed elsewhere to 15,000 for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice Warren Burger
Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings D. S.C. who also chairs the Senate appropriations subcommittee for the department attached 10 million for an advanced technology initiative including work on high-definition television
His Republican counterpart Sen. Warren Rudman R. N.H. has used his position to wage a legislative war with the conservative board of the Legal Services Corp
An estimated 321 million is provided to maintain the program but Mr. Rudman also succeeded in attaching language seeking to curb the authority of the current board until new members are confirmed
The effective date of any new regulations by the current board would be delayed until Oct. 1 next year and the bill seeks to reverse efforts by the corporation to cut off funds to service organizations such as the Food Research and Action Center
The bill also provides 620.5 million to meet U.S. contributions to international organizations and 80 million for peace-keeping activities
Both accounts reflect significant increases from fiscal 1989 although the amount for peace-keeping shows a 27 % cut from the administration 's request
Mercury Savings & Loan Association said it retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets as its lead investment banker to advise it regarding a possible sale or other combination of the Huntington Beach Calif. thrift
Mercury which has assets of more than 2 billion and 24 branches in California said the action to improve its regulatory capital position is related directly to new capital requirements mandated by recently adopted federal legislation
Mercury also said it extended its two-year advisory relationship with Montgomery Securities of San Francisco
Mercury 's stock closed yesterday at 4.875 unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Watching Congress sweat and grimace through its annual budget labors fighting the urge to spend more we 're reminded of those late-night movies in which the anguished serial killer turns himself in to police and says Stop me before I kill again
The Members know they 're doing wrong but they need help to restrain their darker compulsions
Arkansas Democrat David Pryor spilled his guts on the Senate floor the other day after he 'd joined the Finance Committee 's early-morning pork-barrel revels I must tell you I come to the floor tonight as one who ended up with a busload of extraneous matter
It was nothing more or nothing less than a feeding frenzy
He was turning himself in
Frankly as I was walking back to get in my car I heard many many people opening champagne bottles and celebrating individual victories that some of us had accomplished in getting our little deal in the tax bill and winking at this person for slipping this in he said
As I was driving home I did not feel very good about myself
We can applaud Mr. Pryor 's moment of epiphany even as we understand that he and his confreres need restraint lest they kill again
A good place to start the rehabilitation is a legislative line-item veto bill now being offered by Indiana Senator Dan Coats
The Coats bill which already has 32 Senate co-sponsors is n't a pure line-item veto because it would apply only to spending bills
Instead it 's a form of enhanced rescission giving a President a chance to rescind or strike specific spending items that just go too far
Under the proposal a President would have a chance twice each year to return a package of rescissions to the Hill once when he proposes his budget and again after Congress disposes
Congress would have 20 days to reject the package with a 50 % majority but then a President could veto that rejection
Congress would then need the usual two-thirds majority to override any veto
The proposal would restore some discipline erased from the budget process by the 1974 Budget Reform Act
Before 1974 a President could impound or refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson were both big users of the impoundment power but Congress saw its chance against a weakened President Nixon and stripped it away
Today a President can still send up spending rescissions but they 're meaningless unless Congress has a guilty conscience and changes its mind
This is like asking foxes to feel remorse about chickens and naturally rescissions are almost never approved
In 1987 President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill but only 3 % of the spending total was approved by Congress
Senator Coats 's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless Congress acts
The Members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest goodies but the police in the form of a President would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy as they do now
Mr. Coats plans to offer his proposal as an amendment to a bill to raise the federal debt limit before the end of the month
President Bush has endorsed the idea and at least 50 sitting Senators have voted to support enhanced rescission authority in the past
We 're told Senator Pryor is n't yet a co-sponsor but if he and his colleagues are serious about kicking their compulsions they 'll sign up
Business and civic operations lurched back toward normalcy here as congressional officials estimated that the price tag for emergency assistance to earthquake-ravaged California would total at least 2.5 billion
That is a minimum figure and I underscore minimum said House Speaker Thomas Foley D. Wash
after conferring with California lawmakers
It 's impossible to put an exact figure on it at this time
The Office of Management and Budget has begun looking into legislation to provide more funds for earthquake repairs
And California 's 45-member delegation in the House is expected to propose that emergency funds be added to a stop-gap spending bill that the House Appropriations Committee is to consider Monday
For the most part major corporations ' headquarters and plants were unaffected or only slightly damaged by Tuesday 's earthquake which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale
One of the last big employers in the Silicon Valley to report in Seagate Technology said it expects to be back at full strength Monday
The day before the quake Seagate completed three days of emergency training and drills
Echoing the response of almost all big corporations in the Bay Area Don Waite Seagate 's chief financial officer said I would n't expect this to have any significant financial impact
The city 's recovery from the earthquake was uneven
Banks indicated they were operating at greater than 90 % of their usual capacity but a Nob Hill hotel said tourists had fled leaving the previously full hotel with an 80 % vacancy rate
City crews tallied the wreckage to buildings but lacked a clear sense of how gravely transportation arteries were disabled
Among the city 's banks Bank of America said all but eight of its 850 branches were open
The closed branches in San Francisco Hayward Santa Clara and Santa Cruz sustained structural damage
Power failures kept just seven of its 1,500 automated-teller machines off-line
Securities-trading operations were moved to Bank of America 's Concord office and foreign-exchange trading operations were shifted to Los Angeles the bank said
Wells Fargo & Co. said its Emergency Operations Committee which met all night Tuesday moved its global-funds transfer system to El Monte Calif. 500 miles to the south
Only five of 496 branches statewide remain closed while 23 of 600 automated-teller machines remained out of order
The most extensive damage was in small towns near the quake 's epicenter 80 miles south of San Francisco
Santa Cruz County estimates total damage at nearly 600 million
Santa Clara County has a running total so far of 504 million excluding the hard-hit city of Los Gatos
Oakland officials were still uncertain about the magnitude of structural damage late yesterday a section of I-880 a twotiered highway collapsed in Oakland causing a majority of the deaths resulting from the quake
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos estimated that damages to the city total 2 billion
That includes dwellings in the ravaged Marina district that must be demolished peeled business facades south of Market Street and houses in the city 's outer Richmond district that were heaved off their foundations
Many streets and sidewalks buckled and subterranean water mains and service connections ruptured
The federal funds would go to a range of programs including the Federal Emergency Management Agency highway construction accounts and the Small Business Administration according to Rep. Vic Fazio D. Calif

FEMA which coordinates federal disaster relief is already strapped by the costs of cleaning up after Hurricane Hugo which hit the Carolinas last month
It is likely to get as much as 800 million initially in additional funds and eventually could get more than 1 billion according to Mr. Fazio a member of the House Appropriations Committee
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there is enough money on hand to deal with immediate requirements
The Bush administration has at its disposal 273 million in funds remaining from the 1.1 billion Congress released for the cleanup after Hurricane Hugo
We feel we have the money necessary to handle the immediate short-term requirements Mr. Fitzwater said
He added that the Office of Management and Budget the Transportation Department and other agencies are developing longer-term legislation that should be ready soon
Much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve repairing highways and bridges
California lawmakers are seeking changes in rules governing the federal highway relief program so more money can be made available for the state
Some things ca n't be repaired
The Asian Art Museum in Golden Gate Park reports 10 million to 15 million in damage including shattered porcelains and stone figures
Its neighbor the De Young Museum totaled 3 million to 5 million in structural damage and shattered sculpture
The city 's main library is closed because of fissures that opened in its walls and marble facings and ornamental plaster at the Beaux Arts City Hall broke off in the temblor
The ground along the Embarcadero the street that skirts the city 's eastern boundary and piers dropped six inches after the quake wreaking major damage to at least one of the piers
At San Francisco International Airport shock waves wrecked the control tower knocking down computers and shattering glass
Offices of the city 's Rent Board were destroyed
Mayor Agnos 's 2 billion estimate does n't include damage to freeway arteries leading into the city some of which remained closed
A major chunk of the 2 billion is expected to be eaten up by overtime for city workers deployed in the emergency said a spokesman for Mr. Agnos
All of the city 's 5.9 million emergency reserve was spent in the first 24 hours on overtime salaries he said
Insurers struggled to to get a firm grasp on the volume of claims pouring into their offices
At Fireman 's Fund Corp. a spokesman said 142 claims were received in the first 24 hours after the quake and the company is braced for as many as 5,000 claims from its 35,000 residential and 35,000 business policyholders in the affected area
Claims range from a scratched fender and there were an awful lot of cars damaged in this to a major processing plant a spokesman said
We 're delivering a check for 750,000 to an automotive business in Berkeley that burned on Tuesday
Fireman 's is part of a 38 million syndicate that supplies business interruption insurance to the city on the Bay Bridge which must pay employees during the three weeks or more it is expected to be out of service and deprived of toll income
California lawmakers want to eliminate temporarily a 100 million cap on the amount of federal highway relief for each state for each disaster as well as a prohibition on using the emergency highway aid to repair toll roads
In addition under the highway-relief program the federal government provides 100 % of emergency highway aid for only the first 90 days of a repair effort
After that the federal share diminishes
For interstate highways the federal share normally would drop to 90 % of the cost of repairs and the state would have to pick up the remainder of the cost
But lawmakers want to extend the period for 100 % federal funding for several months
Those changes also would apply to two areas hit hard by Hurricane Hugo South Carolina and the U.S. Virgin Islands according to an aide to Rep. Fazio
Meanwhile the FEMA announced a toll-free telephone number 800-462-9029 to expedite service to victims of the earthquake
Lines will be available 24 hours a day to take applications for such disaster relief as temporary housing and emergency home repairs by phone
Transportation officials are expecting utter traffic pandemonium beginning Monday and growing worse over the next several weeks
Some 250,000 cars normally cross the closed Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco daily
Officials say it is clear that alternate routes ca n't handle the overflow
The state is calling in a flotilla of navy landing vessels and other boats to expand ferry service across the bay and hopes to add numerous new bus routes and train departures to help alleviate the traffic problem
Moreover state officials are urging freight haulers to bypass many of the area 's main highways and to travel late at night or during predawn hours
Even so We 're looking for chaos said George Gray a deputy district director at the California Department of Transportation
If there 's any way you can do it you ought to go to Idaho and go fishing for a while
Most of San Francisco 's tourists and business travelers already have left despite hotel 's offers of rate cuts
Everyone left said Peter Lang reservations manager of the Mark Hopkins Hotel
The Westin St. Francis hotel which survived the 1906 earthquake and fire currently is less than 50 % occupied

Is an American Secretary of State seriously suggesting that the Khmer Rouge should help govern Cambodia Apparently so
There are no easy choices in Cambodia but we ca n't imagine that it benefits the U.S. to become the catalyst for an all-too-familiar process that could end in another round of horror in Cambodia
Now that Vietnam appears to have pulled out its occupation army the State Department is talking again about accepting an interim coalition government in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh
The coalition would include the current Vietnamese-backed Hun Sen regime the two non-communist resistance groups led by Son Sann and Prince Sihanouk and the Khmer Rouge
The aim would be to end the guerrilla war for control of Cambodia by allowing the Khmer Rouge a small share of power
The State Department says that any Khmer Rouge participation would have to be minimal
The usual problem with including communists in interim coalition governments is that their ideology and methods require they squeeze out everyone else
Recall that Nicaragua 's Sandinistas came into Managua as partners in a coalition government with anti-Somoza moderates
Within two years the moderates were exiled or in prison Nicaragua had gone communist and the Sandinistas were building one of the biggest armies in Latin America and threatening their neighbors
In Laos when the Western powers bowed to pressure for such a coalition it turned out they were opening the door to communist domination
Even Mao Tse-tung 's China began in 1949 with a partnership between the communists and a number of smaller non-communist parties
What complicates the scene in Cambodia is that the current regime is already communist as are its Vietnamese overseers back in Hanoi as are the Khmer Rouge who are the strongest of the three guerrilla groups
It 's not clear which crew of communists might prevail in a coalition government but the one good bet is that the non-communists would disappear
That would leave Hun Sen and the Khmer Rouge
The Hun Sen regime has sent thousands of conscript laborers to die of malaria and malnourishment while building Cambodia 's equivalent of the Berlin Wall near the Thai border
The Khmer Rouge however carry an unsurpassed record for Cambodian tyranny
These utopians caused the deaths by starvation disease or execution of well over one million Cambodians
The Cambodian horror was so bad that the Vietnamese occupation in 1978 was a perverse form of relief
The world might want to believe that the Khmer Rouge ca n't still be such bad guys just as in the late 1970s it was reluctant to credit the reports of genocide then taking place
But there is no solid evidence that the Khmer Rouge have changed
Some of our sources in Thailand say the notorious old Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot has been holed up this summer in Khmer Rouge camps near the Thai-Cambodian border
So it 's difficult to swallow the notion that Mr. Baker is willing to accept conditions that would help the Khmer Rouge set up shop again in Phnom Penh
True Prince Sihanouk backs the idea of such a coalition at least for this week
But Prince Sihanouk has backed all sorts of ideas over the years and done rather better by himself than by Cambodia
Nor should the U.S. worry much about offending China which still aids the Khmer Rouge
It 's time the State Department recognized that China does not play by gentlemen 's rules
For the U.S. to lend even the slightest support to the most infamous killers on Indochina 's bleak scene could only disturb America 's allies elsewhere
It would be entirely rational for communist insurgents in countries such as the Philippines or Peru to conclude the following Fight viciously enough and the U.S. under the banner of pragmatism might eventually help negotiate your way to victory
U.S. diplomacy has done it before and it will likely do it again
The administration and Congress have lately tangoed around the idea of sending military aid to Cambodia 's non-communists
But now the possibility of diplomatic movement Vietnam 's withdrawal the Baker initiative has put that plan on hold with the proviso that if the going got rough the U.S. would then rearm the opposition
Why the timidity At the very least the odds are heavily weighted against the prospects of preventing the Khmer Rouge and Cambodia 's communists from ultimately moving against their opponents
When that day comes it would be particularly awful to know that the United States sat on military aid and deprived these people of the means to settle their fate with at least a little honor

Cipher Data Products Inc. posted a net loss of 14.2 million or 97 cents a share for its fiscal first quarter compared with net income of 3.8 million or 27 cents a share a year ago
Revenue for the quarter ended Sept. 30 fell 20 % to 41.3 million from 51.9 million in the year-earlier period
Cipher Data a San Diego maker of magnetic tape peripherals and optical disc drives said the loss included reserves of 3.8 million related to a corporate restructuring
The restructuring calls for a 24 % reduction in its work force over the next two months affecting about 525 jobs Cipher Data said
It is eliminating the positions of president and chief operating officer formerly held by Edward L. Marinaro
Cipher Data said Mr. Marinaro consequently has resigned from those posts and from the company 's board

FileNet Corp. Costa Mesa Calif. said it expects to report a third-quarter loss of about 1.8 million or 17 cents a share because of a 2.5 million reserve to be taken against potential losses on a contract with the state of California
Revenue is estimated at 18.6 million
The maker of document image processing equipment said the state procurement division had declared FileNet in default on its contract with the secretary of state uniform commercial code division
FileNet said it does n't believe the state has a valid basis of default and is reviewing its legal rights under the contract but said it ca n't predict the outcome of the dispute
The disagreement centers on testing deadlines and other issues involving a FileNet system installed earlier this year
State officials could n't be reached for comment late yesterday
FileNet noted that it had cash and marketable securities totaling 22.5 million on Sept. 30 and stockholders ' equity is 60.1 million
The company made the announcement after the close of the markets where its stock finished at 10.75 up 25 cents in over-the-counter trading

From Chevy trucks to Lipton iced tea to a host of battling banks the state has been inundated with broadcast commercials and print advertising campaigns celebrating Texans and castigating outsiders
While advertisers have long appealed to Texans ' state pride and prejudices the latest trend has been sparked in part by the state 's recent hard economic times
That has taken some of the swagger out of natives who like to brag that Texas is the only state that was once a nation but it has increased their legendary resentment of outsiders
In the past writes Houston Chronicle columnist Jim Barlow outlanders were accepted only after passing a series of tests to prove they had the right Texas attitudes and of course they had to be dipped for parasites

Dell Computer Corp. squeezed by price pressure from its larger competitors and delays in its new product line said its per-share earnings for fiscal 1990 will be half its previous forecasts
Although the personal computer maker said it expects revenue to meet or exceed previous projections of 385 million for the year ending Jan. 28 1990 earnings are expected to be 25 cents to 35 cents a share down from previous estimates of 50 cents to 60 cents
Earnings for fiscal 1989 were 14.4 million or 80 cents a share on sales of 257.8 million
Results for the third quarter ending Oct. 31 are expected to be released the third week of November according to Michael Dell chairman and chief executive officer
Mr. Dell said he does n't expect a loss in either the third or fourth quarter but said third-quarter earnings could be as low as four cents a share
In the third quarter last year Dell had net income of 5 million or 26 cents a share on sales of 75.2 million
Mr. Dell attributed the earnings slide to new product delays such as a laptop scheduled for September that wo n't be introduced until early November
Some delays have been caused by a shortage of micoprocessors notably Intel Corp. 's newest chip the 486 but others apparently have been caused by Dell 's explosive growth and thinly stretched resources
They 've got a lot of different balls in the air at the same time observes Jim Poyner a computer securities analyst with Dallas-based William K. Woodruff & Co
Mr. Dell meanwhile concedes the company was definitely too optimistic in its expectations
Product delays however have left Dell buffeted by harsher competition in its bread-and-butter line of desktop computers as powerhouse competitors Compaq Computer Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. price their PCs more aggressively
The result has been thinner margins which have been further eroded by an ambitious research and development effort and rapid overseas expansion
Analyst James Weil of the Soundview Financial Group believes Dell 's response has been to place increased emphasis on product quality in an effort to rise above some of that price pressure
But that has been the key to Compaq 's success he adds whereas Dell carved out its market niche as a direct seller of low-cost but reliable computers and it might be too late in the game for a shift in strategy
In national over-the-counter trading Dell closed yesterday at 6 a share down 87.5 cents
TransAtlantic Holdings PLC a British-based South African-controlled financial services investment group and France 's Societe Centrale Union des Assurances de Paris reached an accord effectively reducing chances of an unfriendly takeover for Sun Life Assurance Society PLC
In a joint statement the two companies whose combined holdings equal 52.7 % of Sun Life 's ordinary shares said their agreement is aimed at reducing the uncertainty and instability for Sun Life that has resulted from two major shareholders owning a controlling interest in the company
TransAtlantic whose Transol Investments Ltd. unit owns the largest minority stake in Sun Life has agreed not to make a takeover bid for the British life insurer without the prior consent of the French company known as UAP
In return the agreement would force UAP to buy TransAtlantic 's 29.8 % holding in Sun Life or sell its 22.9 % stake to TransAtlantic at a price set by Transatlantic
Pride Petroleum Services Inc. said it agreed to buy well-servicing assets of two companies and expects to report higher third-quarter revenue and earnings
In the year-earlier quarter the well-servicing contractor had net income of 319,000 or 3 cents a share on revenue of about 15 million
Results for the earlier quarter included a 100,000 restructuring charge
Separately the Houston concern said it signed letters of intent for the cash and stock purchases of a total of 29 well-servicing rigs from two concerns located in New Mexico and California
It did n't disclose specifics but said it expects to complete the purchases by Nov. 1
Schlumberger Ltd. New York reported third-quarter net income edged up as growth in its oil-field services sector offset a decline in interest income
The lower interest income occurred because Schlumberger spent 1.2 billion buying back its stock last year
Net for the oil-field services and electronic measurements and systems concern rose to 114.2 million or 48 cents a share from 112.2 million or 42 cents a share a year earlier
Per-share earnings advanced 14 % because of the buy-back
Revenue declined 6.3 % to 1.11 billion from 1.18 billion
But excluding businesses acquired or sold revenue was flat at about 1.24 billion
Nine-month net fell 9.5 % to 323.4 million or 1.36 a share from 357.2 million or 1.32 a share a year earlier
Revenue dropped 5.4 % to 3.48 billion from 3.68 billion
This year 's nine-month results include gains of 13 million or five cents a share from the sale of Schlumberger 's defense systems business and 22 million or nine cents a share from an award by the IranU.S
Claims Tribunal
The year-earlier nine months include a gain of 35 million or 13 cents a share from sale of the company 's Electricity Control & Transformers division

The French building group Dumez S.A. said profit jumped 70 % in the first half of 1989 partly on the strength of nonrecurring gains from a share issue by its Canadian unit
Dumez said group profit after payments to minority interests rose to 252 million francs 40.1 million from 148 million a year earlier
Revenue rose 40 % to 13.32 billion francs from 9.53 billion
The group noted that 75 million francs of the advance reflected a one-time gain from the June offering by its United Westburne unit in Canada
It did n't say if its year-earlier results were influenced significantly by nonrecurring elements
For all of 1988 Dumez had group profit of 452 million francs after payment to minority interests
Revenue was 21.98 billion francs
The group has n't forecast full-year earnings for 1989 although it said that its first-half results are n't a good indication because of one-time elements and the seasonal nature of its operations
Tuesday 's earthquake will depress local real-estate values in the short term and force companies to reconsider expanding in or relocating to the Bay Area and California real-estate and relocation specialists said
Few specialists said they expect the quake to have much of an effect on most California property values
But real-estate experts and brokers said the quake undoubtedly will drag down prices in neighborhoods built on less stable ground especially in the Bay Area
California prices were already coming down
This is n't going to help said Kenneth T. Rosen chairman of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California at Berkeley
State housing prices at a median 201,028 have declined in recent months because of potential buyers ' inability to afford homes
Mr. Rosen among others suggested that the quake the strongest since the 1906 temblor that struck San Francisco will in the short term create a two-tier price system for quake-prone communities with dwellings built on sturdy ground likely to demand higher prices
One San Francisco neighborhood likely to test Mr. Rosen 's theory soon is the city 's fashionable Marina district which boasts some of the highest home prices in the state

They noted that because the consumer price index known as the CPI is a more comprehensive measure of inflation and is rising less rapidly than the producer-price index or PPI it could signal further easing by Fed
Others suggested however that the Fed will hold any changes in monetary policy in check leaving fed funds at around 8 3\/4 % down from the 9 % level that prevailed from July through September

American Medical said it would pursue the inquiries from the companies but would n't identify them unless they make firm offers
H&R Block is one of the great success stories of U.S. business
Oddly enough this presents a problem for the stock
Some money managers are disenchanted with H&R Block because they suspect the company 's glory days are past or at least passing
Block 's tax-preparation business is mature they say and some of its diversifications are facing tough competition
It 's no secret that Block dominates the mass-market tax-preparation business
The Street knows all about the predictability of its earnings which are headed for a ninth consecutive yearly increase
The company has consistently earned more than a 20 % annual return on its net worth while many companies would be happy with 15 %
But the tax-preparation business simply has no more room to grow says Mark Cremonie director of research for Capital Supervisors Inc. a Chicago firm that manages 6.5 billion
You go to any medium-sized town in the U.S. and you 're going to see H&R Block tax services
Mr. Cremonie 's firm once held about 4.8 % of H&R Block
That was before the 1986 tax reform made taxes more complex than ever
One thing you can bet on he says is that Congress will do stupid things with the Tax Code
But Capital Supervisors sold the last of its H&R Block holdings earlier this year
They 're thrashing around for diversification he says
I think a lot of their businesses are just so-so
Last week the stock hit an all-time high of 37 1\/4 before getting roughed up in the Friday-the-13th minicrash
It closed yesterday at 34 3\/4
To be sure the stock still has a lot of fans
If you invested 10,000 in the initial public offering in 1962 it would be worth well over 5 million today says Fredric E. Russell a Tulsa Okla. money manager
I do n't know what the risk is of holding the stock
Taxes are not going out of business
Many of his peers feel the same way
The number of big institutions that own H&R Block shares is 207 and growing according to a midyear tally by CDA Investment Technologies
Brokerage houses are sweet on H&R Block too
Zacks Investment Research counts five brokerage houses that consider the stock a buy and four that call it a hold
None dare say to sell it
But some money managers are doing just that
Eugene Sit president of Sit Investment Associates in Minneapolis says When we bought it we thought the growth rate was going to accelerate because of computerized tax filing and instant refunds the customer gets a refund immediately but pays extra to the tax preparer which waits for Uncle Sam 's check
But neither of those developments did much to juice up growth Mr. Sit says
He figures Block earnings are now growing at about a 10 % annual rate down from about 14 % the past five years and will grow at an 8%-10 % rate in the future
That 's not bad Mr. Sit says but it sure does n't justify Block shares being priced at 15 to 16 times estimated earnings for fiscal 1990
He wants stocks whose price\/earnings ratio is less than their growth rate as he figures it H&R Block does n't even come close
Two other money managers in explaining why they have sold large amounts of H&R Block stock this year spoke on the condition they not be named
The stock was going no place and the earnings were so-so said one
In the past two years the stock almost stalled out
It was above 33 adjusted for a subsequent split in 1987 and has n't gotten much higher since
There 's no more growth in the tax business except for increasing prices the money manager added
The CompuServe subsidiary which provides information to home-computer users is where the growth is he said but its format is still too complicated
CompuServe provides about 20 % of both sales and earnings
The tax business still provides about 70 % of earnings on about 50 % of sales
Personnel Pool temporary workers mostly in the health-care area chips in close to 25 % of sales but only about 9 % of earnings
The shortage of nurses is crimping profit at Personnel Pool said the second money manager
He concedes H&R Block is well-entrenched and a great company but says it does n't grow fast enough for us
We 're looking for something that grows faster and sells at a comparable price-earnings multiple
Thomas M. Bloch president and chief operating officer says I would disagree that the tax business is mature
For example he says the company is planning to go nationwide with a new service tested in parts of the country aimed at taxpayers who want refunds in a hurry
Mr. Bloch concedes that a recent diversification attempt fell through
We 're still interested in diversifying he says but we 'd rather be prudent than make a mistake
He also says CompuServe 's earnings continue to grow 20 % to 30 % a year in spite of tough competition from giants like Sears and IBM
And he says Block 's other businesses are growing although less consistently

During its centennial year The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history
PUTS AND CALLS STOCK MARKET PATOIS for options to sell or buy a company 's shares were long an arcane Wall Street art best left to the experts who used them either as a hedge or for pure speculation
Options lost some of their mystery in 1973 when the Chicago Board of Trade set up a special exchange to deal in them
Until then options had been traded only in the over-the-counter market mostly in New York and in an almost invisible secondary market operating chiefly by telephone
The Chicago Board of Trade the No. 1 U.S. grain market had long chafed under the attention won by its innovative archrival the livestock-dealing Mercantile Exchange
So the men who ran the grain pits listened when Joseph Sullivan a 35-year-old former Wall Street Journal newsman offered them the idea of all-options trading
After four year of tinkering and 2.4 million in seed money the board set up the new marketplace titled it the Chicago Board Options Exchange and named Sullivan its first president
The beginnings were modest
The CBOE opened for business on April 26 1973 in what had been a Board of Trade lunchroom
It listed just 16 options to buy a pilot list of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange
Puts or sell options would not be added until 1977
The 282 members had paid 10,000 apiece for seats
The 1989 price 250,000
The first day 's business was 911 contracts each for 100 shares of one of the listed stocks
By the end of 1973 the number of underlying Big Board stocks had been increased to 50 and the options exchange had run up volume of 1.1 million contracts
A year later it was 5.7 million
Last year more than 1,800 traders on the CBOE bought and sold 112 million contracts on 178 listed stocks 60 % of all U.S. listed options trading
The new exchange drew instant recognition from an unwelcome quarter
The government campaigning against fixed brokerage commissions promptly sued the CBOE over its minimum-fee system
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruled unanimously that the financial troubles facing the Seabrook N.H. nuclear-power plant have no impact on whether the plant receives a full-power license
Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon opposing the license said he will appeal the ruling in federal court
Seabrook officials said the plant could receive a full-power license by the end of the year
The NRC rejected Mr. Shannon 's argument that Public Service Co. of New Hampshire which owns the largest share of Seabrook and 11 other owners are financially unable to guarantee the plant 's safe operation
Mr. Shannon was seeking a waiver of NRC policy that ignores financial considerations in making licensing decisions
In its ruling the NRC said that because Seabrook will be allowed to charge rates sufficient to run the plant and make payments on past construction costs consideration of the owners ' financial condition is pointless
The commissioners found the circumstances of the case did n't undercut the assurance from government rate setters of available funds adequate for safe operation said a commission spokesman
In January 1988 the utility filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code allowing it to continue to operate while protected from creditors ' lawsuits
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. New York the newly merged drug and health-care-product company reported record third-quarter earnings for both companies in the merger
Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp. Princeton N.J. merged Oct. 4 but the new company reported third-period earnings for both companies
For the fourth quarter Bristol-Myers Squibb will report one set of earnings
Bristol-Myers said net income rose 15 % to 266.2 million or 93 cents a share from 232.3 million or 81 cents a share a year earlier
Sales gained 5 % to 1.59 billion from 1.52 billion
Squibb Corp. said net rose 17 % to 144.5 million or 1.47 a share from 123 million or 1.25 a share
Sales were 730.1 million up 7 % from 679.5 million
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 1.75 to 52.75
PPG Industries Inc. hurt by softness in the U.S. automotive and construction industries said third-quarter net income fell 5.5 % to 106.7 million or 97 cents a share from 112.9 million or 1.03 a share a year ago
Sales were nearly identical to the year-earlier 1.36 billion
The drop in earnings did n't surprise analysts who said the Pittsburgh glass coatings and chemical concern had been predicting a slow quarter because of the sluggish construction industry a major market for the company 's flat glass
Glass sales to Canadian and European auto makers and sales of replacement auto glass in all markets increased
The coating segment also posted higher sales particularly in North America and Europe
But sale increases were offset by slumping sales in flat glass and fiberglass reinforcements the company said
Also chemicals sales were slightly down because of lower prices for vinyl chloride monomer and other chlorine derivatives
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading PPG closed at 41 a share down 37.5 cents
Jefferies Group Inc. said third-quarter net income fell 4 % to 2.2 million or 35 cents a share from 2.3 million or 31 cents a share on more shares a year earlier
Revenue rose 15 % to 36 million from 31.2 million
Jefferies a Los Angeles holding company primarily engaged in securities trading also said stock market declines since the quarter ended Sept. 30 created an unrealized pretax loss of about 6 million in its risk arbitrage account
For the nine months Jefferies said net fell 39 % to 6.8 million or 1.07 a share from 11.1 million or 1.50 a share
Revenue fell 3 % to 105.2 million from 108.4 million
Sony Corp. New York said its bids for Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. have been cleared by federal antitrust regulators
The Japanese company said the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act for the 3.4 billion bid for Columbia and the 200 million offer for Guber-Peters expired Monday
Sony has agreed to buy both companies but is in a legal battle with Warner Communications Inc. over the services of producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Sony also said two more suits have been filed opposing the company 's agreement to buy Columbia
Sony added that a hearing has been set for Thursday in the Delaware Chancery Court in one of the suits

China said the question of Taiwan 's membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should be considered only after China 's own membership in the 97-nation organization is restored
Both China and Taiwan are seeking seats in GATT which sponsors trade-liberalizing agreements and sets world-commerce rules
As one of China 's provinces Taiwan has no right to join GATT on its own Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said
China under the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek was a founding member of GATT in 1947
The Nationalists withdrew in 1950 after their flight to Taiwan and the Communist government in Beijing applied for restoration of China 's membership in July 1986
The U.S. has voiced opposition to China 's bid for GATT membership saying China has yet to undertake needed economic reforms

But the panel dismissed the magazine 's contention that it had n't libeled Mrs. Sutcliffe when it accused her of trying to sell her story to capitalize on the notoriety of her husband
Private Eye had been threatened with closure because it could n't afford the libel payment

Mr. Dang is alleged to have used the account of Singapore hotel and property magnate Ong Beng Seng to effect the transactions
Japan says its economic growth will fall sharply if it cuts back on the use of oil coal and gas to cap emissions of carbon dioxide
A Ministry of International Trade and Industry official said that a study found that Japan 's annual economic growth rate would eventually be only 0.8 % if carbon-dioxide emissions remained at this year 's level of 300 million tons
The study will support arguments against capping carbon-dioxide emissions that Japan will make at a U.N.-backed conference on atmospheric pollution next month
The study said Japan 's carbon-dioxide emissions would slightly more than double by 2010 unless the nation reduced its dependence on fossil fuels
It said that expanding nuclear-power capability is the quickest way to lessen that dependence
But increased reliance on nuclear power would meet stiff opposition from environmentalists a second ministry official said

Slowing sales of its profitable Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer sport utility vehicles are forcing Chrysler Corp. to temporarily idle its Toledo Ohio assembly plant for the first time since April 1986
About 5,500 hourly workers will be laid off for a week beginning Oct. 23 and overtime has been eliminated at the plant for the fourth quarter a Chrysler spokesman said
That 's a significant change from earlier this year when the plant worked substantial overtime only to have sales fall short of the company 's bullish expectations
Sales of Cherokee the best-selling Jeep and the lower-volume Wagoneer were actually up about 10 % through the end of last month
But that 's less than Chrysler officials had hoped when they set ambitious production schedules for the Toledo plant earlier this year
Even when it became clear this spring that demand was n't coming up to expectations Chrysler officials resisted cutting output because Cherokee and Wagoneer are very profitable vehicles the spokesman said
Instead Chrysler officials in late May slapped 1,000 cash rebates on the vehicles including the first such incentives on the popular four-door Cherokee since Chrysler bought Jeep in 1987
The incentives boosted sales for a while but the pace had cooled by last month
The result Chrysler dealers had a bloated 82-day supply of the Cherokee as of the end of last month and a 161-day supply of the Comanche pickup which Toledo also builds
A 60-day to 65-day supply is considered normal
At Jasper Jeep-Eagle one of the largest Jeep dealerships in the country inventories have continued to swell
Steve Lowe general manager of Jasper Ga. dealership said new rebates of 500 to 1,000 on the models have stimulated sales but not enough to significantly cut dealer stocks
If people are n't buying you have to close plants he said
Separately Chrysler said it will idle for four weeks the St. Louis assembly plant that builds the Chrysler LeBaron and Dodge Daytona models
Chrysler officials said the plant is scheduled to resume production on Nov. 20. and 3,300 hourly workers will be affected
General Motors Corp. meanwhile said it will idle for yet another week its Linden N.J. assembly plant bringing to three weeks the total time that plant will be idled during October
GM said the assembly plant which builds the Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta compact cars originally was scheduled to reopen Monday but now will not resume production until Oct. 30
The shutdown affects 3,000 workers and will cut output by about 4,320 cars
Sluggish sales of the Beretta and Corsica spurred GM to offer 800 rebates on those cars
The Corsica and Beretta make up the highest-volume car line at Chevrolet but sales of the cars are off 9.6 % for the year and fell a steep 34.2 % early this month
GM has scheduled overtime at its Lordstown Ohio and Janesville Wis. assembly plants which build the Chevrolet Cavalier
Ford Motor Co. said it will shut down for one week its Kentucky Truck Plant because of a shortage of dealer orders
The shutdown will idle 2,000 hourly employees and eliminate production of about 1,300 medium and heavy duty trucks
The assembly plant is scheduled to resume production on Oct. 30
Meanwhile the nine major U.S. auto makers plan to build 143,178 cars this week down 11.7 % from 162,190 a year ago and flat with last week 's 142,117 car output

LOTUS DEVELOPMENT Corp. 's net income rose 61 % in the third quarter from the year-earlier period
Yesterday 's edition misstated the percentage increase
First Fidelity Bancorp. Lawrenceville N.J. reported a 24 % drop in third-quarter profit because of a decline in earning assets lower loan volume and tighter interest margins
The bank holding company posted net income of 54.4 million or 87 cents a share including 1.7 million or three cents a share in one-time tax benefits
A year earlier net was 71.6 million or 1.22 a share
First Fidelity said non-performing assets increased to 482.3 million Sept. 30 from 393.1 million June 30
The rise resulted from the transfer to non-accrual status of 96 million owed by two national borrowers and one local commercial real-estate customer First Fidelity said
It said it does n't anticipate any loss of principal on two of the loans comprising 85 million of these credits
First Fidelity said it boosted its loan-loss provision to 50.9 million from 20.4 million a year ago primarily because of a weaker real-estate sector in the region
VIACOM Inc. 's loss narrowed to 21.7 million in the third quarter from 56.9 million a year ago

Coastal Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement with Aruba to restart a 150,000-barrel-a-day oil refinery
Coastal would n't disclose the terms
Coastal a Houston oil and gas company said it expects to begin operations in October 1990
The company said it may install additional processing units at the refinery to produce higher octane gasolines and other products
The company said it was leasing the site of the refinery from Aruba
Exxon Corp. built the plant but closed it in 1985 and sold off much of the equipment to dismantling contractors from whom Coastal bought back much of the equipment
A Coastal spokesman said the biggest expense will be to refurbish the refinery but would n't say how much that would be
The prime minister of Aruba has said it could cost around 100 million
Coastal said the refinery 's expected daily production will include 34,000 barrels of jet fuel 32,000 barrels of low-sulfur diesel fuel 30,000 barrels of naphtha 17,000 barrels of residual fuel oil 8,000 barrels of asphalt and 25,000 barrels of low-sulfur catalytic cracker feedstock
Loral Corp. said fiscal second-quarter net income was 19.8 million or 79 cents a share compared with year-earlier earnings from continuing operations of 15.6 million or 62 cents a share
Year-earlier net of 21 million or 84 cents a share included the results of Loral 's former Aircraft Braking Systems and Engineered Fabrics divisions which were sold April 27 to the company 's chairman Bernard L. Schwartz
The defense electronics concern attributed the operating improvement to higher profit margins and lower net interest expense
Loral also reported that its bookings more than doubled to 654 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from 257 million in the year-before period
The increase was due mainly to a 325 million order from Turkey to equip its fleet of F-16 fighters with Loral 's ALQ-178 Rapport III electronic countermeasures system
The order is the biggest in the company 's history
Sales in the latest period edged up to 295.7 million from 293.9 million
Mr. Schwartz said the recent increase in orders puts us well on the way to our goal of 1.6 billion in bookings for the year
He added I expect to see the earnings momentum we experienced this quarter continue for the rest of the year
Loral said it expects sales to accelerate in both the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year
Loral 's profit from continuing operations for the first six months of fiscal 1990 was 36.4 million or 1.44 a share up 31 % from 27.8 million or 1.11 a share a year earlier
Net income fell 8.6 % to 37.1 million or 1.43 a share from 40.6 million or 1.56 a share
Fiscal first-half sales slipped 3.9 % to 528.4 million from 549.9 million
Bookings for the first half totaled 813 million compared with the 432 million recorded last year
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Loral closed at 33.25 down 37.5 cents
HealthVest said two of its lenders have given it notices of default on bank loans and said they may take actions to recover their loans
HealthVest an Austin Texas real estate investment trust said that Chemical Bank the lead bank under its domestic bank agreement told it that if 3.3 million owed to the bank group is n't paid by today the group will call the 120 million that HealthVest has outstanding under the credit line
The bank group also said that it wo n't make additional advances under the 150 million credit line
HealthVest missed a payment to the group that was due in late September
In addition HealthVest said Bank of Tokyo Trust Co. also has notified it of a default and said it might take action to cure the default
HealthVest missed an interest payment to Bank of Tokyo on Oct. 1
However HealthVest said the Tokyo bank indicated that it wo n't accelerate HealthVest 's 50 million loan
HealthVest is in a severe liquidity bind because its affiliate Healthcare International Inc. has failed to make about 10.6 million in principal and interest payments owed since August
Healthcare operates many of the health-care properties that HealthVest owns
EMPIRE PENCIL later called Empire-Berol developed the plastic pencil in 1973
Yesterday 's Centennial Journal misstated the company 's name
Storage Technology Corp. had net income of 8.3 million or 32 cents a share for its fiscal-third quarter ended Sept. 29 almost 15 times the 557,000 or two cents a share it posted for the year-ago period
Storage Louisville Colo. which makes data-storage devices for mainframe computers said the huge increase in net reflects strong sales of its tape products particularly the 4400 Automated Cartridge System which holds a library of tape cartridges
The company said it recently sold its 750th cartridge system which cost 400,000 to 500,000 each
Quarter revenue was 232.6 million up 12 % from 206 million last year
The stock market reacted strongly to the news
Storage rose 1.125 a share to close at 14 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
For the nine months Storage had net of 25.5 million or 98 cents a share including an 11.3 million extraordinary gain for the anticipated proceeds from liquidating an Irish unit
Net was up 69 % from 15.1 million or 57 cents a share last year
Revenue for the latest period was up 11 % to 682.7 million from 614.6 million
A Canadian government agency conditionally approved proposed exports to the U.S. of natural gas from big untapped fields in the Mackenzie River delta area of the western Canadian Arctic
Three companies Esso Resources Canada Ltd. Shell Canada Ltd. and Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. applied to the Canadian National Energy Board to export 9.2 trillion cubic feet of Mackenzie delta natural gas over 20 years starting in 1996
To be economically feasible the 11 billion Canadian dollar 9.37 billion project requires almost a doubling of natural gas export prices
It also faces numerous other hurdles including an agreement on a pipeline route for the gas
The board said the export licenses would be issued on the condition that Canadian interests would also be allowed to bid for the Mackenzie delta gas on terms similar to those offered to U.S. customers
U.S. buyers have already been lined up
They include Enron Corp. Texas Eastern Corp. Pacific Interstate Transmission Co. and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co
The project could result in the U.S. taking more than 10 % of its natural gas supplies from Canada up from about 5 % currently
It would bring 13 gas fields into production at a combined rate of about 1.2 billion cubic feet a day
The board estimated that the cost of building a pipeline from the Mackenzie delta to Alberta would be about 5.9 million
It also said projections of surging U.S. demand for natural gas and price forecasts of 5.25 per thousand cubic feet by 2005 would make the project economically viable
Esso a unit of Imperial Oil Ltd. which is 71%-owned by Exxon Corp. will be allowed to export 5.1 trillion cubic feet to the U.S. in the 20-year period
Shell a subsidiary of Royal Dutch\/Shell Group will be allowed to export 0.9 trillion cubic feet and Gulf a unit of Olympia & York Developments Ltd. will be allowed to export 3.2 trillion cubic feet
Combustion Engineering Inc. Stamford Conn. said it sold and agreed to sell several investments and nonstrategic businesses for about 100 million which will be used for reducing debt and general purposes
The transactions are unrelated
The company agreed to sell its minority investments in makers of steam-generating and related equipment Stein Industrie and Energie & Verfahrenstechnik to the major shareholder in the companies Dutch-based GEC Alsthom N.V
Combustion Engineering which provides engineered products systems and services for power generation also sold Illinois Minerals Co. based in Cairo Ill
That unit of its Georgia Kaolin Co. subsidiary was sold to a unit of Unimin Corp
Assets of Construction Equipment International Houston were sold to Essex Crane Inc. and the assets of Elgin Electronics Erie Pa. were sold to closely held Charter Technologies Inc
Where do Americans put their money It depends on when you look
In 1900 for instance less than 8 % of assets went into bank deposits
That rose to nearly 18 % during the Depression and has n't changed much since
Pension reserves on the other hand made up a relatively small part of household assets until the last decade when they skyrocketed
And there has been a drastic decline in the importance of unincorporated business assets thanks to industry consolidation and a decline in family farms
That 's some of what emerges from the following charts which show how Americans have changed their investment patterns over the past 90 years
Some results are self-explanatory
But other figures are surprising
Housing for instance has remained a fairly steady component of household assets over the past decade although common wisdom would have expected an increase
There is a lot of attention paid to housing as a form of household wealth says Edward N. Wolff professor of economics at New York University
But it has n't increased much relative to other assets
It suggests that households accumulate wealth across a broad spectrum of assets
And housing though it appears in the popular mind as being the major growing household asset is n't
In addition investors ' desire to hold stocks directly and through mutual funds has held surprisingly steady stocks ' importance among assets largely reflects the ups and downs of the stock market and not a shift in stock-holding preferences
Stocks have not spread to the general public despite the fact that the environment is much different concludes Robert Avery an economist at Cornell University
To me it says that despite all the views that we spend too much of our wealth on paper assets we have ways of holding wealth similar to 100 years ago
The charts show how househld assets have been distributed over time

Consumer Durables Automobiles appliances furniture

McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said it sent a letter to LIN Broadcasting Corp. clarifying its revised tender offer for LIN and asking LIN to conduct a fair auction
The letter apparently came in response to a request for clarification by LIN earlier this week
LIN which has agreed with BellSouth Corp. to merge their cellular-telephone businesses said then that it would n't take a position on McCaw 's revised tender offer
Earlier this month McCaw revised its offer to 125 a share for 22 million LIN shares
McCaw is seeking 50.3 % of the cellular and broadcasting concern the revised offer includes a feature requiring McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN
The letter outlines broad powers for an independent group of directors provided for in the revised offer
In a statement Craig O. McCaw chairman and chief executive officer of McCaw said We trust LIN will take no further actions that favor BellSouth
McCaw said the three independent directors provided for in the offer would be designated by the current board
The successors would be nominated by the independent directors
LIN would have a priority right to pursue all opportunities to acquire U.S. cellular interests in markets other than those in which McCaw holds an interest or which are contiguous to those markets unless LIN has an interest there or contiguous to it
Independent directors would have veto rights to any acquisition if they unanimously decide it is n't in LIN 's best interest
Independent directors would be able to block transactions they unanimously deem would be likely to depress the private market value of LIN at the time it is to be sold in five years
If LIN is put up for sale rather than purchased by McCaw in five years McCaw wo n't submit a bid unless the independent directors request it and the independent directors will run the bidding
The directors would be able to sell particular assets to enable such buyers as the regional Bell operating companies to purchase the company 's interests
MCA Inc. said third-quarter net fell 6.3 % to 50.8 million or 69 cents a share from 54.3 million or 74 cents a share a year earlier
MCA said revenue rose 14 % to 918.4 million from 806.7 million
The entertainment concern said the success of several movies released during the quarter including Parenthood and Uncle Buck contributed to record revenue for its film unit
Both MCA 's music-entertainment and book-publishing units also posted record revenue and operating profit
The parent company 's net included a loss which it did n't specify that was related to the company 's 50 % stake in Cineplex Odeon Corp
Cineplex a Toronto theater chain had a second-quarter net loss of 38.7 million
MCA said net also included certain reserves related to the restructuring of its LJN Toys ' international operations
These items were partly offset MCA said by an unspecified gain on the sale of its Miller International unit a maker and distributor of budget-priced audio cassettes
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading MCA rose 1.50 to 64
In the nine months net rose 35 % to 120.1 million or 1.64 a share from 89.2 million or 1.22 a share a year earlier
Revenue increased 22 % to 2.5 billion from 2.1 billion

Helmsley Enterprises Inc. plans to close its company-owned insurance business and is seeking other brokers to take over its policies according to individuals familiar with the New York firm
Helmsley Enterprises is the umbrella organization for companies controlled by Harry B. Helmsley
These include office and residential real estate giant HelmsleySpear Inc. and Helmsley Hotels
The insurance brokerage agency just a fragment of Helmsley 's vast empire would be the first piece of the company to be stripped away since last summer when Mr. Helmsley 's wife Leona Helmsley was found guilty of tax evasion
Industry sources estimate the agency brokers property and casualty premiums worth about 25 million annually and has revenue based on a standard 10 % commission rate of about 2.5 million
The insurance firm acts as a broker on policies covering buildings managed by HelmsleySpear and others
Many of the properties are owned through limited partnerships controlled by Mr. Helmsley
New York State law prohibits insurance brokerages from deriving more than 10 % of revenue from insuring affiliated companies
Helmsley 's insurance division had slightly exceeded that percentage sources say but the division was n't considered significant enough to the company to be restructured particularly at a difficult time for the firm
Adverse publicity from the scandal surrounding its founder 's wife and related management strife have put pressure on the entire Helmsley organization
However individuals close to the company insist shuttering the insurance division a sideline from the company 's core property management business is n't the beginning of a sale of assets
Helmsley 's insurance premiums are expected to be transferred to several different insurance brokerage companies
Frank B. Hall Inc. of Briarcliff Manor N.Y. is reportedly working out an agreement with Helmsley
Officials there declined to comment as did Helmsley management
Outside the white-walled headquarters of the socalled Society of Orange Workers all seems normal in South Africa 's abnormal society
A pickup truck driven by a white farmer rumbles past with a load of black workers bouncing in the back
Over at Conradies the general store a black stock boy scurries to help an elderly white woman with her packages
Down the street a car pulls into the Shell station and is surrounded by black attendants
But inside the white walls of the Orange Workers ' office just about the largest building in town save for the Dutch Reformed Church and the school South Africa 's neat racial order is awry
A dozen white office workers fold newsletters and stuff them into envelopes
White women serve tea and coffee and then wash the cups and saucers afterwards
White children empty the wastepaper baskets and squeegee the windows
There is n't a black worker in sight
Not in the kitchen or the storeroom or the book shop
If we want to have our own nation then we must be willing to do all the work ourselves says Hendrik Verwoerd Jr. son of the former prime minister and the leader of the Orange Workers founded in 1980
They do indeed want their own nation
The pillars of apartheid may be trembling in the rest of South Africa with Johannesburg opening its public facilities to all races blacks storming the all-white beaches of the Cape and the government releasing seven leaders of the banned African National Congress
But here in Morgenzon a sleepy town amid the corn fields of the eastern Transvaal the Orange Workers are holding the pillars steady
The Orange Workers who take their name from William of Orange of the Netherlands a hero of the Dutch-descended Afrikaners believe that the solution to South Africa 's racial problems is n't the abolition of apartheid it 's the perfection of apartheid complete and total separation of the races
Here then is where the Orange Workers have come to make apartheid 's last stand
Their idea is to create a city first and then an entire nation without blacks
This may seem to be a preposterous and utterly futile effort in Africa
And the fact that there are only 3,000 card-carrying Orange Workers may put them on the loony fringe
But their ideal of an Afrikaner homeland an all-white reserve to be carved out of present-day South Africa is a mainstream desire of the right-wing which embraces about one-third of the country 's five million whites
Afrikaner philosophers and theologians have long ruminated on the need for a white homeland
The Orange Workers are just putting this preaching into practice
Thus farmer Johan Fischer his T-shirt and jeans covered in grease crawls around under his planter tightening bolts and fixing dents
On almost every other farm in South Africa black workers do the repairs
But not here
Mr. Fischer plows his own fields sows his own corn and sunflowers and feeds his own sheep
Over at the fiberglass factory four white workers assemble water tanks on their own and in their spare time they build townhouses across the road
On Main Street Alida Verwoerd and her daughters look after the clothes and fabric shop then hurry home to fix lunch for the rest of the family
Down by the stream a group of Orange Workers puts the finishing touches on a golf course
If whites want to play there by themselves says consulting engineer Willem van Heerden whites should also build it by themselves
If we want to survive as a people he says we have to change our way of life
The Afrikaner must end his reliance on others
In their quest to perfect apartheid the Orange Workers have discovered a truth that most of privileged white South Africa tries mightily to deny The master ca n't become dependent on the slave and expect to remain master forever
If apartheid means you want cheap black labor and all the comforts that go with it but you also want to exclude the blacks from social and political integration then these are two contradictions that ca n't go on forever says Mr. Verwoerd
He is sitting in his living room beneath a huge portrait of his late father Hendrik F. Verwoerd apartheid 's architect and South African prime minister from 1958 to 1966
Somewhere the son sighs things went terribly wrong with apartheid today whites even rely on blacks to police their separation
People took separate development as an opportunity to use black labor without ever getting rid of it
But my father meant it to mean real separation says the son
The Orange Workers speak sincerely
We agree with world opinion that the status quo in South Africa is morally wrong says Pieter Bruwer the Orange Workers ' chief scribe and pamphleteer
We must either integrate honestly or segregate honestly
Morgenzon has long been a special domain of Afrikanerdom
According to Mr. Verwoerd the early Afrikaner pioneers were the first people to settle in the eastern Transvaal even before the blacks
Then when Morgenzon was incorporated in 1908 the farmer who owned the land stipulated that only whites could reside in town blacks could work there but they had to leave at night
Today Morgenzon is a town of 800 whites and two paved roads
Weeds push up through the cracks in the sidewalks and many houses and storefronts are empty
There are few factories and no mines
It was an ideal place for the Orange Workers to start their new nation unencumbered by the demographics that have undermined apartheid elsewhere in South Africa
So far about 150 Orange Workers have moved here spending nearly 1 million buying up property over the past three years
Still complete and total segregation remains elusive
Just beyond the city limits is a shantytown of 2,000 blacks who are employed throughout the area
Despite the Orange Workers ' intention to put them all out of work they are in no hurry to leave
A young man called July that 's when he was born who works at the railroad station just up the street from the Orange Workers office points at the whitewalled building and says matter-of-factly We 're not allowed in there that 's all I know
The 650-or-so local whites who are n't Orange Workers are more troubled
Try as they might they just ca n't conceive of life without black workers
Impossible impossible say the Conradies an elderly couple who have run the general store for decades
We ca n't do without their help says Mrs. Conradie
Oh no
We need them and I thank God for them
Over at the Shell station owner Rudi van Dyk who doubles as Morgenzon 's mayor worries that the Orange Workers have made his town the laughingstock of the nation
What they want us to do just is n't practical he says noting that he employs 16 blacks
I could n't afford to hire 16 whites
The only Afrikaners who would be willing to work for this salary would n't know how to handle money
Back at the Verwoerd house Hendrik Sr. peers down over the shoulder of Hendrik Jr
The son believes that when the Afrikaners finally realize there is no turning back the integration of South African society and politics Morgenzon will boom
We urge our people not to wait until they have to fight for their own nation says Mr. Verwoerd
By populating a place now we make ourselves a power any new government will have to take into account
Curiously he compares the Orange Workers to the ANC which his father outlawed in 1960
The ANC wo n't be stopped until there is a provision for black aspirations says Mr. Verwoerd
Likewise no government will stop this idea of the Afrikaners
He apologizes for sounding pushy
Look he says If the rest of South Africa wants to have an integrated melting pot that 's their choice
We 'll leave them alone
We just want to have our own cup of tea
And they will even serve it themselves
Okay now you can pick up that phone
But do n't do anything rash
After last Friday 's stock-market plunge investment professionals cautioned people to resist the urge to call their brokers and sell stocks
Not selling into a panic turned out to be very good advice Despite the market 's volatility the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged 114 points in the past four days
Now with a semblance of normalcy returning some advisers say it 's time for investors to take a hard cold look at the stocks they own and consider some careful pruning
The market is sending nervous signals says Peter J. Canelo chief market strategist for Bear Stearns & Co. and it 's unwise to be overcommitted to stocks
Alan Weston president of Weston Capital Management a Los Angeles money-management firm adds that in periods of uncertainty like today it 's a good time to cut out the dead branches of your portfolio
Not everybody agrees that it 's time to trim
We are n't inclined to prune stock portfolios now says Steven G. Einhorn chairman of the investment policy committee of Goldman Sachs & Co
Investors should stay with their stocks
We expect a choppy and sloppy market for a short period but we do n't think it will be ugly
The downside is limited
And even those who say some selective selling may be in order stress that individuals need to be in the stock market to achieve their long-term investment objectives and to help balance their other assets
Any selling they say should be well thought-out and executed gradually during market rallies
They offer these suggestions GET RID OF THE DOGS
Sell stocks that are n't doing well now and that do n't have good earnings prospects says Alfred Goldman technical analyst at St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards & Sons
Most people do just the opposite They sell their winners and keep their losers
Which types of stocks are most likely to qualify Technology stocks says Mr. Goldman
WATCH FOR EARNINGS DISAPPOINTMENTS
A company does n't have to post a loss to be a candidate for sale says Charles I. Clough Jr. chief market strategist at Merrill Lynch & Co
If earnings do n't live up to analysts ' expectations he says that 's enough to dump the stock
John Markese director of research for the American Association of Individual Investors raises a cautionary note
Substituting a rule of thumb for your own judgment can be a mistake he says
An earnings disappointment may reflect a situation that 's short-term
But Mr. Clough says The risk is that earnings disappointments will continue
The economy is decelerating after six good years and right now it 's better to shoot first and ask questions later
Which types of stocks currently have the greatest earnings risks Computer companies commodity cyclical stocks like autos and retailing stocks he says
BEWARE OF HEAVY DEBT
The companies apt to run into earnings problems soonest are the ones with heavy debt loads says Larry Biehl partner in the San Mateo Calif. money-management firm of Bailard Biehl & Kaiser
Mr. Canelo of Bear Stearns agrees If we do have an economic slowdown he says companies with high debt ratios will be dumped en masse
The best course for individual investors is to sell these stocks now the two advisers say
SELL WHISPER STOCKS
UAL Corp. 's difficulty in obtaining bank financing for its leveraged buy-out and its resulting price plunge is a tip-off to what 's going to happen to takeover stocks says Mr. Canelo
Takeover activity will slow down as more and more banks tighten their lending requirements he says
There 'll be fewer and fewer deals
Moreover many financial advisers say individuals should be in the stock market as long-term investors not as traders trying to catch the next hot stock
In general they say avoid takeover stocks
COMPARE P\/E RATIOS WITH PROSPECTS
Mr. Canelo suggests that investors compare price\/earnings ratios the price of a share of stock divided by a company 's per-share earnings for a 12-month period with projected growth rates
If you think earnings will grow at 20 % a year it 's all right to pay 20 times earnings he says
But do n't pay 30 times earnings for a company that 's expected to grow at 15 % a year
Mr. Canelo thinks the market will probably go higher but will be ruthless with stocks if the earnings are n't there
Mr. Markese cautions that investors should n't slavishly follow any specific price\/earnings sell trigger
If you say sell anytime a company 's price\/earnings ratio exceeds 15 that knocks out all your growth stocks he says
You eliminate companies with substantial prospects that are moving up in price
EXAMINE WHAT HAS CHANGED
Tom Schlesinger market analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. says investors should consider selling if there has been a fundamental change in a company since they bought its stock
Say you purchased a stock because of a new product that was in the works
Now because of various difficulties the product has been scrapped
Time to sell says Mr. Schlesinger
Similarly he says suppose you were attracted to a company because of expectations that sales would hit 200 million by 1990
If things have n't worked out that well and sales wo n't hit 200 million until 1992 it 's time to consider selling he says
USX Corp. declined a United Steelworkers request for a reopening of its four-year labor contract that is due to expire Jan. 31 1991
The union on Oct. 5 requested that the contract be reopened to restore all pay and benefits that the union gave up in the 1982-83 and 1986-87 rounds of bargaining
A United Steelworkers spokeman said Lynn Williams the union 's president was out of town
The union wo n't respond to the USX statement until Mr. Williams has studied it the spokesman said
Robert A. Oswald chief financial officer and a director of this natural-gas pipeline company was elected to the additional position of executive vice president
In addition Michael W. O'Donnell executive vice president of a Columbia unit was named assistant chief financial officer and a senior vice president of the parent company
The appointments take effect Nov. 1
Both men are 44 years old
This magazine and book publisher said three men were elected directors increasing the board to 10
They are James R. Eiszner 62 years old and chairman and chief executive officer of CPC International Inc. Robert G. Schwartz 61 chairman president and chief executive officer of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and Walter V. Shipley 53 chairman and chief executive officer of Chemical Banking Corp
BankAmerica Corp. reported a 34 % jump in third-quarter earnings as its rocket-like recovery from nearly ruinous losses several years ago continued to be fueled by growth in consumer loans higher interest margins and negligible loan losses
For the quarter BankAmerica said it earned 254 million or 1.16 a share compared with 190 million or 97 cents a share a year earlier
BankAmerica spokesmen said preliminary reports indicate the company was n't materially affected by the Tuesday earthquake
All but eight of the 850 branches which had some structural damage reopened yesterday for business
Automated teller machine operations also were up and operating yesterday a bank spokesman said
For the first time in nearly two years BankAmerica results failed to improve in consecutive quarters but the decline from the second quarter was attributable to special factors
Third-quarter profit was 16 % below the 304 million or 1.50 a share earned in the 1989 second quarter
The company cited higher tax credits in the second quarter totaling 63 million compared with 28 million in the third quarter
Excluding tax credits profit was 6 % below the second quarter
But that drop was caused entirely by a decline in Brazilian interest paid to 5 million from 54 million the second quarter
Moreover BankAmerica continued to build its reserve against troubled foreign loans by boosting its loan-loss provision to 170 million about the same as the previous quarter but well above the 100 million in the year-earlier quarter
The provision rate was far above BankAmerica 's actual net credit losses of 24 million in the third quarter compared with 18 million in the second period and 38 million a year earlier
As a result BankAmerica said its reserve against troubled foreign-country loans once below 25 % now amounts to 45 % of the 6.4 billion of non-trade debt it calculates it is owed by those nations
That level is about the same as some other big banks but far below the 85 % and 100 % reserves of Bankers Trust New York Corp. and J.P. Morgan & Co. respectively
By any measure third-quarter earnings were still robust equivalent to a 0.92 % return on assets even excluding tax credits
By that key measure of operating efficiency BankAmerica turned in a better performance than its well-regarded Los Angeles-based competitor Security Pacific Corp. which posted a 0.89 % return in the third quarter
But it continued to badly trail its San Francisco neighbor Wells Fargo & Co. which reported an extraordinary 1.25 % return on assets
Both returns do n't include any tax credits
They BankAmerica continue to show good performance said Donald K. Crowley an analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. San Francisco
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange BankAmerica common stock edged up 12.5 cents to close at 32 a share
Shareholder equity improved to 4.68 % from 4.23 % in the previous quarter
The 4.52 % net interest margin or the difference between the yield on a bank 's investments and the rate it pays for deposits and other borrowings was still markedly higher than the 3.91 % ratio a year earlier and is among the best in the industry analysts said
The high margin partly stems from continued strong growth in high-yielding consumer loans which jumped 31 % to 17.47 billion from a year earlier and residential mortgages which rose 25 % to 12 billion
BankAmerica 's total loans rose 8 % to 71.36 billion
For the nine months BankAmerica profit soared 81 % to 833 million or 4.07 a share from 461 million or 2.40 a share
International Business Machines Corp. will announce on Tuesday a slew of software products aimed at eliminating some of the major problems involved in computerizing manufacturing operations industry executives said
Many plant floors currently resemble a Tower of Babel with computers robots and machine tools that generally speak their own language and have trouble talking to each other
As a result if a problem develops on a production line it is unlikely some supervisor sitting in front of a personal computer or workstation will know about it or be able to correct it
So IBM will be announcing more than 50 products that will be aimed at letting even the dumbest machine tool talk to the smartest mainframe or anything in between
In an unusual display of openness IBM also will be helping customers tie together operations that include lots of equipment made by IBM 's competitors
In addition the executives said IBM will be offering programming tools designed to let anyone working on a factory floor write ad-hoc software for instance to do statistical analysis that would pinpoint a problem on a manufacturing line
In Armonk N.Y. an IBM spokeswoman confirmed that IBM executives will be announcing some computer-integrated-manufacturing plans next week but declined to elaborate
The industry executives said that as usual with such broad announcements from IBM this one will be part reality and part strategy
So it will take many quarters for IBM to roll out all the products that customers need and it will take years for customers to integrate the products into their operations
Also as usual the products will appeal mostly to heavy users of IBM equipment at least initially
Still consultants and industry executives said the products could help make manufacturing operations more efficient and provide a boost to the computer-integrated-manufacturing market a market that Yankee Group a research firm has said may double to 40 billion by 1993
This is a step in the right direction said Martin Piszczalski a Yankee Group analyst
He added though that a lot of this is intentions
We 'll have to wait and see how the plan develops
The announcements also should help IBM go on the offensive against Digital Equipment Corp. on the plant floor
While IBM has traditionally dominated the market for computers on the business side of manufacturing operations and has done well in the market for design tools Digital has dominated computerized manufacturing
Hewlett-Packard Co. also has begun to gain share in the whole computer-integrated-manufacturing arena
IBM will face an uphill climb against Digital given Digital 's reputation for being better than IBM at hooking together different manufacturers ' computers
In addition Hewlett-Packard while a much smaller player has made a big commitment to the sorts of industry standards that facilitate those hookups and could give IBM some problems
Both can be expected to go after the market aggressively Gartner Group Inc. a research firm estimated the Digital gets 30 % of its revenue from the manufacturing market and Hewlett-Packard gets 50 %
IBM which Gartner Group said generates 22 % of its revenue in this market should be able to take advantage of its loyal following among buyers of equipment
That is because many companies will standardize on certain types of equipment as the various parts of the manufacturing market merge and IBM is the biggest player
But much will depend on how quickly IBM can move
The whole idea of computer-integrated manufacturing CIM seems to be making a comeback after losing a little luster over the past couple of years when it became apparent that it was n't a panacea that would make U.S. plants more efficient and banish foreign competition
Erik Keller a Gartner Group analyst said organizational changes may still be required to really take advantage of CIM 's capabilities someone on the shop floor may not like having someone in an office using a personal computer to look over his shoulder for instance and may be able to prevent that from happening
But he said a system such as IBM 's should help significantly
In making polyethylene sheets out of plastic chips for instance a chip sometimes does n't melt gets caught in the machinery and creates a run in the sheets
That can be expensive because the problem may not be noticed for a while and the sheets are typically thrown away
But Mr. Keller said that if computers can be integrated into the process they could alert an operator as soon as the problem occurred
They could also check through the orders on file to find a customer that was willing to accept a lower grade of polyethylene
The computer would let the machine run just until that order was filled eliminating waste
This sort of improved link figures to eventually become a significant weapon for some companies
Companies might be able to tell salespeople daily for instance about idle equipment so they could offer discounts on whatever that equipment produces
Salespeople also could get a precise reading on when products could be delivered in much the same way that Federal Express has marketed its ability to tell exactly where a package is in the delivery system
Ford Motor Co. 's Merkur the company 's first new car franchise in the U.S. since the Edsel was unveiled in 1957 now will share Edsel 's fate
Ford said yesterday it will halt imports of the Merkur Scorpio a 28,000 luxury sedan built by Ford of Europe in West Germany
The cars are sold under a separate franchise with its own sign in front of Lincoln-Mercury dealers as opposed to new models such as Taurus or Escort which are sold under existing Ford divisions
The move to halt imports announced 29 years and 11 months to the day after Henry Ford II declared that the Edsel division and its gawky car would be scrapped kills the four-year-old Merkur brand in the U.S. market
It will continue to be sold in the European market
Merkur 's death is n't nearly as costly to Ford as was the Edsel debacle because Merkur was a relatively low-budget project with limited sales goals
Still Merkur 's demise is a setback for Ford at a time when the company 's image as the U.S. auto maker with the golden touch is showing signs of strain
The No. 2 auto maker 's new Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar models have n't met sales expectations in the year since they were introduced and Ford 's trucks are losing ground to their GM rivals
This fall Ford introduced only one new product A restyled version of its hulking Lincoln Town Car luxury model
The demise of Merkur pronounced mare-COOR comes after a September in which 670 Merkur dealers managed to sell only 93 Scorpios
Total Merkur sales for the first nine months dropped 46 % from a year ago to just 6,320 cars
Merkur is n't the only European luxury brand having problems in the U.S.
The Japanese assault on the luxury market is rapidly overshadowing such European makes as Audi and Saab which at least have clear brand images
Merkur as an import on domestic car lots suffered from the same sort of image confusion that is hobbling sales of imports at General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp
Merkur was originally aimed at enticing into Lincoln-Mercury dealerships the kind of young affluent buyers who would n't be caught dead in a Town Car a vehicle so bargelike that Ford is staging a press event next month linking the Town Car 's launch to the commissioning of a new aircraft carrier in Norfolk Va
But the brand had trouble from the start
The first Merkur the XR4Ti went on sale in early 1985
The sporty coupe foundered in part because American buyers did n't go for the car 's unusual double-wing rear spoiler
In May 1987 Ford began importing the Scorpio sedan from West Germany to sell next to a redesigned XR4Ti in showrooms
Ford officials said they expected the two Merkurs would sell about 15,000 cars a year and in 1988 they reached that goal as sales hit 15,261 cars
It was downhill from there however
One major factor was the decline of the dollar against the mark which began less than a year after Merkur 's 1985 launch
As the West German currency rose so did Merkur prices
The Merkur cars also suffered from spotty quality some dealers say
It was like a comedy of errors says Martin J. Hoot McInerney a big dealer whose Star Lincoln-Mercury-Merkur operation in Southfield Mich. sold more XR4Ti 's than any other dealership
But by the third quarter of 1988 Scorpios had a high satisfaction rating in internal Ford studies a spokesman said
Apparently however the improvement came too late
Last fall Ford announced it would discontinue the XR4Ti in the U.S. at the end of the 1989 model year
Ford said then it would keep the Scorpio
This year Scorpio sales plummeted and at the current sales pace it would take Ford 242 days to sell off the current Scorpio inventory of about 4,600 cars
Canadian Pacific Ltd. said it proposed acquiring the 44 % of Soo Line Corp. it does n't already own for 19.50 a share or about 81.9 million after failing to find a buyer for its majority stake earlier this year
Soo Line said its board appointed a special committee of independent directors to study the proposal
The troubled Minneapolis-based railroad concern said the committee has the authority to hire financial and legal advisers to assist it
The proposed acquisition will be subject to approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission Soo Line said
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday Soo Line shares jumped well above the proposed price closing at 20.25 up 2.75
Canadian Pacific put its 56 % stake in Soo Line up for sale last year but could n't find any takers
Canadian Pacific which has interests in transportation telecommunications forest products energy and real estate finally took its majority block off the market this spring
It turned out we could n't sell it a Canadian Pacific official said adding that acquiring the remainder of Soo Line is now the best way to rationalize operations
Canadian Pacific is Soo Line 's biggest customer and has owned a majority stake in the U.S. railroad since 1947
Canadian Pacific and Soo Line tracks connect at two points in the West on the Canada-U.S. border and the two companies operate a very successful Chicago-Montreal rail service
Separately for the first nine months Soo Line reported a loss of 398,000 or four cents a share compared with net income of 12.5 million or 1.32 a share a year earlier
Revenue fell 5.8 % to 407.9 million from 433.2 million
The company had a loss from operations of 1.7 million
Golden Nugget Inc. reported a third-quarter net loss of 13.1 million or 76 cents a share based on 17.2 million common shares and dilutive equivalents outstanding
The results compare with a year-earlier net loss of 1.5 million or seven cents a share based on 20.3 million common and dilutive equivalents outstanding
Operating revenue rose 25 % to 52.1 million from 41.8 million a year ago
Results for the latest quarter include nonoperating items of 23.9 million versus 8.4 million a year earlier
Most of the expenses stem from the company 's huge Mirage resort-casino scheduled to open next month along the Strip and an April 1989 financing by units operating the downtown Golden Nugget property
For the nine months Golden Nugget reported a net loss of 11.4 million or 69 cents a share based on 16.6 million common and dilutive equivalents outstanding
The year earlier the company had a net loss of 4.3 million or 20 cents a share based on 21 million common shares and dilutive equivalents outstanding
The 1988 results include a 10.7 million charge stemming from a litigation judgment
Separately the casino operator said its board approved a plan to buy-back as many as three million common shares from time to time either in the open market or through private transactions
An additional 299,000 shares are authorized for repurchase under an earlier stock buy-back program
John Uphoff an analyst with Raymond James & Associates said the results were n't surprising and attributed the buy-back to management 's confidence in the Mirage 's ability to generate strong cash flow in 1990
Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Golden Nugget common closed at 28.25 up 2
Capital Holding Corp. said it requested and received the resignation of John A. Franco its vice chairman as an officer and a director of the life insurance holding company
The company said Mr. Franco developed a plan to establish a business that might be competitive with Capital Holding Corp. 's Accumulation and Investment Group which Mr. Franco headed
The group temporarily will report to Irving W. Bailey II chairman president and chief executive officer of Capital Holding
Mr. Franco 47 years old said in a telephone interview that he has been considering and discussing a number of possible business ventures but that nothing is at a mature stage
He said he did n't argue with the company 's decision to seek his resignation because contemplating outside business ventures can distract an executive from performing his best at the job he is paid to do
Martin H. Ruby a managing director of Capital Holding 's Accumulation and Investment Group also resigned to pursue other business interests Capital Holding said
Mr. Ruby 39 said that he had an amicable parting with Capital Holding and that he has a number of ventures in the financial-services area under consideration
He said that his resignation was a mutual decision with Capital Holding management but that he was n't actually asked to resign
The Accumulation and Investment Group is responsible for the investment operations of all Capital Holding 's insurance businesses and markets guaranteed investment contracts to bank trust departments and other institutions
It also sells single-premium annuities to individuals
Mr. Bailey said he expects to name a new group president to head that operation following the Nov. 8 board meeting

PLASTIC PENCILS CODE-NAMED E-71 made their hush-hush debut in children 's pencil boxes at five-and-dime stores in 1973
But few knew it then and most still think all pencils are wooden
Eagle Pencil of Shelbyville Tenn. Pencil City U.S.A. had made its earliest pilot plastic pencils in 1971
But it was n't until after it hired Arthur D. Little a Cambridge Mass. research concern that its new product was refined for commercial sale in 1973
Three A.D.L. inventors applied April 6 1973 for the patent which was assigned and awarded in 1976 to Hasbro Industries then Eagle 's parent
Pencil pushers chew and put the plastic models behind their ears just like traditional pencils made of glued strips of California incense cedar filled with ceramic lead
It takes five steps to make standard pencils just one for the plastic type
Automated machines coextrude long plastic sheaths with graphite-plastic cores that are printed cut painted and eraser-fitted
After more than 200 years something new has happened to pencils said Arthur D. Little in a 1974 report that publicly described the previously secret item
Eagle 's plastic type sharpens and looks like a wooden pencil
A major difference is that a snapped wooden pencil will have a slivered break while a plastic model will break cleanly
The softness of the core constrains the plastic models to No. 1 No. 2 or No. 3-type pencils which account for the bulk of the market
Artists and draftsmen need harder leads
Eagle now called Eagle-Berol remains a leading company among the 10 in the U.S. that produced about 2.3 billion pencils last year according to the Pencil Makers Association
It 's a trade secret how many were plastic and most writers still do n't know what they 're using
H.F. Ahmanson & Co. the nation 's largest thrift holding company posted a 12 % earnings decline for the third quarter while another large California savings and loan Great Western Financial Corp. reported a slight earnings gain
H.F. Ahmanson parent of Home Savings of America reported third-quarter net of 49.2 million or 50 cents a share down from 56.1 million or 57 cents a share in the year-earlier period
Most of the earnings decline reflected an increase in the company 's effective tax rate to 44 % from 37 % in the year-ago third quarter when nonrecurring tax credits were recorded the company said
Pretax earnings declined 1.3 %
For the nine months Los Angeles-based H.F. Ahmanson had profit of 128.1 million or 1.29 a share a 4.6 % decline from earnings of 134.2 million in the year-ago nine months
The company said the decline was attributable to a 79 % reduction in net gains on loan sales this year
Third-quarter spreads widened to the highest level in two years as loan portfolio yields rose and money costs declined the company said
Great Western Financial said third-quarter profit rose slightly to 68.4 million or 52 cents a share from 67.9 million or 53 cents a share from a year ago
Great Western based in Beverly Hills Calif. is a financial services firm and parent to Great Western Bank an S&L
Great Western said it had a sharp increase in margins in the recent third quarter
Margins are the difference between the yield on the company 's earning assets and its own cost of funds
But a reduction in one-time gains on the sale of various assets and an increase in the company 's provision for loan losses held down the earnings gain the company said
Great Western 's provision for loan losses was increased to 27.9 million for the recent quarter compared with 21.8 million a year ago primarily as a result of continued weakness in various commercial and multifamily real estate markets outside California
For the nine months Great Western posted net of 177.5 million or 1.37 a share a 5.9 % decline from 188.7 million or 1.48 a share in the year-ago period
Dun & Bradstreet Corp. posted a 15 % rise in third-quarter earnings
But revenue declined more than 2 % reflecting in part a continuing drop in sales of credit services in the wake of controversy over the company 's sales practices
The information company also cited the stronger dollar the sale last year of its former Official Airline Guides unit and other factors
Net income rose to a record 155.3 million or 83 cents a share from 134.8 million or 72 cents a share
Revenue fell to 1.04 billion from 1.07 billion
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Dun & Bradstreet closed yesterday at 53.75 down 25 cents a share
Analysts said the results were as expected but several added that the earnings masked underlying weaknesses in several businesses
The quality of earnings was n't as high as I expected said Eric Philo an analyst for Goldman Sachs & Co
For example he noted operating profit was weaker than he had anticipated but nonoperating earnings of 14.6 million and a lower tax rate helped boost net income
Dun & Bradstreet said operating earnings rose 8 % excluding the sale of Official Airline Guides
Third-quarter sales of U.S. credit services were disappointingly below sales of a year earlier Dun & Bradstreet said
As previously reported those sales have been declining this year in the wake of allegations that the company engaged in unfair sales practices that encouraged customers to overpurchase services
The company has denied the allegations but has negotiated a proposed 18 million settlement of related lawsuits
Analysts predict the sales impact will linger
There is n't much question there will continue to be a ripple effect said John Reidy an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc
Dun & Bradstreet noted that price competition in its Nielsen Marketing Research Nielsen Clearing House and Donnelley Marketing businesses also restrained revenue growth
It cited cyclical conditions in its Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and D&B Plan Services units
For the nine months net income rose 19 % to 449 million or 2.40 a share from 375.9 million or 2.01 a share a year earlier
Year-earlier earnings reflected costs of 14.3 million related to the acquisition of IMS International
Revenue rose slightly to 3.16 billion from 3.13 billion
Control Data Corp. said it licensed its airline yield-management software to the International Air Transport Association
Terms include a royalty arrangement but details were n't disclosed
The computer equipment and financial services company said IATA a trade group will sell access to the package to its 180 airline members world-wide
Control Data will receive revenue linked to the number of passengers served by the software IATA said
The package helps carriers solve pricing problems such as how to react to discounts offered by competitors or what would be the optimum number of seats to offer at a given price
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. said it decided to proceed with installation of automatic gauge and shape controls at its 60-inch tandem cold rolling mill in Allenport Pa
The new equipment which will produce steel sheet with more uniform thickness and flatness is likely to cost more than 20 million the company said
When the company last considered adding the equipment two years ago it estimated the cost at 21 million to 22 million but a task force will have to prepare a detailed plan before the company can predict the current cost
The time schedule for installing the equipment also will be developed by the task force the company said

In the long frightening night after Tuesday 's devastating earthquake Bay Area residents searched for comfort and solace wherever they could
Some found it on the screen of a personal computer
Hundreds of Californians made their way to their computers after the quake and checked in with each other on electronic bulletin boards which link computers CB-radio-style via phone lines
Some of the most vivid bulletins came over The Well a Sausalito Calif. board that is one of the liveliest outposts of the electronic underground
About two-thirds of the Well 's 3,000 subscribers live in the Bay Area
The quake knocked The Well out for six hours but when it came back up it teemed with emotional first-hand reports

Georgia-Pacific Corp. exceeding some analysts ' expectations said third-quarter earnings rose 56 % to 178 million or 2.03 a share from 114 million or 1.19 a share in the year-earlier period
Sales increased 10 % to 2.65 billion from 2.41 billion
Per-share earnings were enhanced by the company 's share buy-back program which reduced the average shares outstanding to 87.5 million in the quarter from 95.8 million in the same quarter of 1988
With strong prices in the company 's two major areas building products as well as pulp and paper analysts had expected a roaring quarter
But the performance exceeded some estimates of around 1.90 a share
Fueling the growth among other things were higher-than-expected prices for certain building products
One reason efforts to protect the spotted owl led to restrictions on logging in the Pacific Northwest constricting supply and forcing prices up
Another reason strikes both at Georgia-Pacific and other lumber companies also cut supplies and raised prices analysts said
For the nine months Georgia-Pacific 's earnings increased 49 % to 504 million or 5.58 a share from 338 million or 3.41 a share
Sales rose 11 % to 7.73 billion from 6.94 billion

The House Public Works and Transportation Committee approved a bill that would give the Transportation Department power to block airline leveraged buy-outs despite a clear veto threat from the Bush administration
The 23-5 vote clears the way for consideration on the House floor next week or the week after
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner in a letter to the committee warned that he would urge President Bush to veto the legislation if it passed Congress
The Senate Commerce Committee already has approved similar legislation
On Monday a letter from Mr. Skinner 's deputy Elaine Chao said the administration opposed the legislation in its present form
Some of the bill 's supporters had taken heart from the fact that the letter was n't signed by Mr. Skinner and that it did n't contain a veto threat
The stepped-up administration warnings annoyed some lawmakers especially senior Republicans who supported the bill because they thought the Transportation Department favored it
We backed this bill because we thought it would help Skinner one Republican said and now we 're out there dangling in the wind
A few weeks ago Mr. Skinner testified before Congress that it would be cleaner more efficient if he had authority to block buy-outs in advance
But he never took an official position on the bill and has steadfastly maintained that he already has enough authority to deal with buy-outs
Under the committee bill the Transportation secretary would have 30 days and an additional 20 days if needed to review any proposed purchase of 15 % or more of a major U.S. airline 's voting stock
The secretary would be required to block an acquisition if he concluded that it would so weaken an airline financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the carrier 's ability to compete or if it gave control to a foreign interest
Although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt
Supporters of the bill are concerned an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt
The panel 's action occurs in a politically charged atmosphere surrounding recent buy-out proposals their apparent collapse and the volatile conditions in the stock market
It became apparent in hearings that there ought to be regulation of leveraged buy-outs of some sort Rep. James Oberstar D. Minn. chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee said during the panel 's deliberations
I do n't believe in the airline business you can be totally laissez-faire because of the high degree of public interest at stake
But Mr. Skinner disagreed calling the legislation a retreat from the policy of deregulaton of the airline industry
In his letter to Committee Chairman Glenn Anderson D. Calif. the secretary also said the bill would be at odds with the administration 's policies welcoming open foreign investment and market allocation of resources
Currently the Transportation Department does n't have the authority to block a takeover in advance
However if the secretary concludes that a transaction has made a carrier unfit to operate the department may revoke its certificate grounding the airline
Such authority is more than adequate say opponents of the legislation
But supporters argue that grounding an airline is so drastic that the department would hesitate doing it
The panel rejected a proposal pushed by AMR Corp. the parent of American Airlines to allow the Transportation secretary to block corporate raiders from waging proxy fights to oust boards that oppose a leveraged buy-out
It also voted down proposals to give the secretary much more discretion on whether to block a buy-out and to require the department to consider the impact of a buy-out on workers
London shares rallied to post strong gains after initial fears evaporated that the California earthquake would depress Wall Street prices
Tokyo stocks which rebounded strongly Tuesday extended their gains yesterday but most other Asian and Pacific markets closed sharply lower
In London the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index jumped 34.6 points to close at its intraday high of 2170.1
The index was under pressure for most of the morning over concerns that the effects of Tuesday night 's major earthquake in the San Francisco area would undermine the U.S. market
The mood changed after dealers reappraised the direct impact of the disaster on shares and Wall Street rebounded from early losses
The Financial Times 30-share index settled 27.8 points higher at 1758.5
Volume was 449.3 million shares the slowest of a hectic week compared with 643.4 million Tuesday
U.K. composite or non-life insurers which some equity analysts said might be heavily hit by the earthquake disaster helped support the London market by showing only narrow losses in early trading
The insurers ' relative resilience gave the market time to reappraise the impact of the California disaster on U.K. equities dealers said
Dealers said the market still has n't shaken off its nervousness after its bumpy ride of the past several sessions caused by interest-rate increases last week and Wall Street 's 6.9 % plunge Friday
But technical factors including modest gains in the value of the pound helped draw buying back into the market and reverse losses posted a day earlier
Among composite insurers General Accident rose 10 pence to 10.03 15.80 a share Guardian Royal climbed 5 to 217 pence Sun Alliance rose 3 to 290 and Royal Insurance jumped 12 to 450

Dealers said the market was nervous ahead of a special B.A.T holders ' meeting today
The session is to consider a defensive plan to spin off assets to fend off Sir James Goldsmith 's 13.4 billion bid for B.A.T
The recent stock market drop has shaken confidence in the plan but dealers said the shares fell initially on questions about whether Mr. Goldsmith 's highly leveraged bid will come to fruition

On Wednesday shares were pushed up by index-related buying on the part of investment trusts as well as small orders from individuals and corporations traders said
Institutions meanwhile stepped back to the sidelines as the direction of U.S. interest rates remained unclear
The uncertainty was multiplied by the persistent strength of the dollar traders said and by the U.S. trade deficit which widened by 31 % in August from the previous month
Traders and analysts said they did n't see any effect on Tokyo stocks from the California earthquake
The impact on Japanese insurers and property owners with interests in the San Francisco area is still being assessed they said
Buying was scattered across a wide range of issues making the session fairly characterless traders said
With uncertainty still hanging over interest rates and the dollar the market failed to find a focus that might lead to further investor commitments they said
Some traders said the popularity of issues that gained yesterday wo n't last long as investors will rotate their buying choices over the short term
Interest rate-sensitive shares such as steel construction and electric utility companies which rose early in the week saw their advance weaken yesterday
Traders said these issues need large-volume buying to push up their prices so substantial gains are n't likely unless institutional investors participate
An outstanding issue in yesterday 's session was Mitsubishi Rayon which surged 95 to 905 yen 6.34 a share

The percentage change is since year-end
Housing construction sank in September to its lowest level since the last recession the Commerce Department reported
Work began on homes and apartments at an annual rate of 1,263,000 units last month down 5.2 % from August the department said
The September decline followed an even steeper drop of 6.2 % in August and left housing starts at their weakest since October 1982 when the country was nearing the end of a recession
Originally the department had reported the August decline as 5 %
The numbers suggest that the housing industry is still suffering the effects of the Federal Reserve 's battle against inflation
The industry had shown signs of recovery this summer after the central bank began to relax its clamp on credit allowing interest rates to drop a bit after pushing them up for a year
Sales of new homes rose and inventories of houses which had been climbing dropped
But last month new construction in all types of homes waned from single-family houses to large apartment complexes
It 's pretty much weak across the board said Martin Regalia chief economist of the National Council of Savings Institutions
Mr. Regalia said the industry may be reluctant to step up building at the moment for fear the inventories of unsold homes will increase again
Another reason for the weakness he said may be that mortgage rates have hit a plateau since they began edging down after a peak in March
In August rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages started creeping up a bit but they inched down again through September
Rates have n't really peeled off that much Mr. Regalia said
We 've kind of settled now into an interest-rate environment that 's fairly high
Work was begun on single family homes the core of the housing market at an annual rate of 971,000 in September a drop of 2.1 % from the previous month
That followed a 3.3 % decline in August
Construction of apartments and other multi-family dwellings slipped 2.2 % to an annual rate of 1,022,000 following a 3.5 % decline in August
The number of building permits issued for future construction dropped 2.4 % to a 1,296,000 annual rate after rising 3.7 % in August
All the numbers were adjusted for normal seasonal variations in building activity
The housing starts numbers however are one of the least precise of the government 's economic indicators and are often revised significantly as more information is collected
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. posted a sharp third-quarter turnaround from a year earlier but net income would have dropped from the second quarter without a 37 million after-tax gain
The securities firm posted third-quarter net of 66 million or 64 cents a share compared with a restated year-earlier loss of 3 million or 11 cents a share
Revenue climbed 25 % to 3.3 billion from 2.6 billion
The latest period included the gain which was 77 million before tax from the previously announced sale of the institutional money management business of Lehman Management Co
The 1988 period was restated from net income of 8 million to correct an overstatement in the company 's Boston Co. subsidiary

It is quite unfortunate that you failed so miserably in reporting the Hurricane Hugo disaster
Your Sept. 27 page-one article Charleston Lost Quite a Lot to Hugo Especially Gentility leaves the impression that the storm was little more than an inconvenience
The damage reported focused on a select few who owned irreplaceable historic homes on the Battery
Not mentioned were the 50,000 people rendered homeless and the more than 200,000 out of work for an indeterminable period the 1 billion-plus in losses to homes and personal property on the barrier islands the near and long-term impact on the state 's largest industry tourism not to mention the human suffering
In centering on the disruption of a few proud local customs such as the historic homes tour and the damage to the antiquities your reporter served to only perpetuate an outdated and stereotypically provincial view of this otherwise thriving port city
The damage will undoubtedly prove to be one of the epic human and economic disasters of the decade in this country
David M. Carroll Columbia S.C
Your story was tasteless and insensitive
Depicting the people of a traumatized city reeling from a disaster of unprecedented proportions was at the very best ludicrous under the circumstances
Your narrow focus appears to be a contrived attempt to show the people of that historic city to be doddering fools
You had to have been blind not to see the scenario there for what it was and is and will continue to be for months and even years a part of South Carolina that has sustained a blow that the Red Cross expects will cost that organization alone some 38 million

Affiliated Bankshares of Colorado Inc. said it agreed to sell its 10 % interest in Rocky Mountain Bankcard Systems for 18.5 million to Colorado National Bank of Denver and Central Bank of Denver
Colorado National is a unit of Colorado National Bankshares Inc. and Central is a unit of First Bank System of Minneapolis
Affiliated said it expects to record a pretax gain of about 18.5 million from the sale of the credit-card business which should more than offset any reduction in the carrying value of real estate and real-estate loans on its books
The U.S. Export-Import Bank tentatively decided to guarantee commercial bank financing for the purchase of two Boeing Co. 767 airliners by Avianca Colombia 's international airline at a cost of about 150 million
The loan guarantee would amount to about 127.5 million or 85 % of the cost of the aircraft
Because of the size of the proposed loan guarantee the Ex-Im Bank 's preliminary commitment is subject to review by the House and Senate Banking committees
Ex-Im Bank officials said this review process currently is under way
Sebastian Guzman Cabrera took over the oil workers union Mexico 's most powerful labor organization only last January
But even in that short time Mr. Guzman Cabrera has become as controversial in his own way as his deposed predecessor Joaquin Hernandez Galicia known as La Quina
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari used the army to oust La Quina who reigned for 28 years over a graft-riddled empire that made state-run Petroleos Mexicanos or Pemex one of the world 's most inefficient oil companies
Now Mr. Guzman Cabrera is facing accusations that he 's as much a company man as La Quina was a crook
In recent contract negotiations with Pemex management Mr. Guzman Cabrera accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the union 's role in subcontracting long a source of millions of dollars in illicit earnings
And with the quiet pragmatism of Mr. Guzman Cabrera replacing the prickly populism of La Quina government technocrats have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment
Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's new order has n't arrived without resistance
Brawls between union factions still erupt at Pemex installations
Leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas publicly questioned Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's moral quality suggesting he is part of a conspiracy to turn over the country 's oil a symbol of Mexican nationalism to foreigners
The 61-year-old Mr. Guzman Cabrera takes such criticisms in stride
This is n't a new kind of union leadership it 's a new Mexico
We 're no longer afraid of associating with private or foreign capital he says
Pemex which produces 40 % of government revenue desperately needs new investment
Since world oil prices collapsed in 1982 the government has siphoned Pemex 's coffers to make payments on Mexico 's 97 billion foreign debt
Little money has been returned to upgrade Pemex 's aging facilities
While the government drains Pemex from above the union has drained it from below
A bloated payroll and pervasive graft caused Pemex 's operating costs to balloon to 95 cents of each 1 in sales far above the industry norm
The declines in investment and efficiency explain in part why Mexico has been importing gasoline this year
Some projections show Mexico importing crude by the end of the century barring an overhaul of operations
Whatever you tried to change whether it was cutting costs or attracting new partners the big obstacle was the old union leadership says oil consultant George Baker
Enter Mr. Guzman Cabrera who has a clear understanding of where union leaders fit in the pro-enterprise regime of President Salinas
I 'm the secretary-general if there is one he says greeting a visitor to his office
Beginning as a laborer in a refinery Mr. Guzman Cabrera put in more than 40 years at Pemex before being pushed into retirement by La Quina after a dispute two years ago
Though he also long benefited from the system built by La Quina Mr. Guzman Cabrera says union perks had simply gotten out of hand
They are at the base of all of the problems of corruption he says
Thus in recent contract negotiations Mr. Guzman Cabrera gave up the union 's right to assign 40 % of all of Pemex 's outside contracts an enormous source of kickbacks
The union also ceded the 2 % commission it had received on all Pemex maintenance contracts
The union will keep a 2 % commission on construction projects
The new contract also eliminates the 15 monthly coupon good only at union-owned grocery stores that was part of the salary of every worker from roughneck to chief executive
About 9,800 technical workers notably chemists and lawyers were switched to non-union status
Also because of its reduced capital budget Pemex has phased out about 50,000 transitory construction workers reducing the work force to about 140,000 the union leader says
Mr. Guzman Cabrera says the union 's sacrifices will be offset by a wage and benefit package that amounts to a 22 % increase in compensation
But Pemex managers are the ones most thrilled by the contract
We are retaking the instruments of administration says Raul Robles a Pemex subdirector
Pemex officials would n't say how much money the new contract would save the company but one previous government estimate pegged savings at around 500 million a year
Pemex 's customers also are pleased with the company 's new spirit
Grupo Desc a big conglomerate has long depended on Pemex petrochemicals to produce plastic packing material
But when the Pemex plant shut down for an annual overhaul it would never give notice to its customers
The capriciousness would completely disrupt our operations says Ernesto Vega Velasco Desc 's finance director
This year for the first time Desc and other customers were consulted well in advance of the Pemex plant 's shutdown to ensure minimal inconvenience
Taming the union complements previous moves by the government to attract private investment in petrochemicals which Mexico has been forced to import in large quantities in recent years
In May the government unveiled new foreign investment regulations that create special trusts allowing foreigners long limited to a 40 % stake in secondary petrochemical companies to own up to 100 %
Later the government reclassified several basic petrochemicals as secondary products
But Pemex 's courtship with private companies and especially foreign ones is controversial in a country where oil has been a symbol of national sovereignty since foreign oil holdings were nationalized in 1938
They are preparing the workers for what 's coming foreign control wrote Heberto Castillo a leftist leader
Mr. Guzman Cabrera and government officials insist that foreigners will be limited to investing in secondary petroleum products
But the new union leader makes no apologies for Pemex 's more outward-looking attitude
If we do not integrate into this new world of interdependence sooner or later we 're going to become victims of our own isolation he says
Couple Counseling Grows to Defuse Stress MORE EXECUTIVES and their spouses are seeking counseling as work and family pressures mount
Some employers initiate referrals especially if work problems threaten a top manager 's job
Many couples are like ships passing in the night a communications gulf that sparks problems on the job and at home says psychologist Harry Levinson
His Levinson Institute in Belmont Mass. has seen in recent years a doubling in the number of executives and spouses at its weeklong counseling program
Employers foot the bill he says figuring what 's good for the couple is good for the company
One East Coast manufacturing executive faced with a job transfer his wife resented found that counseling helped them both come to grips with the move
And the vice president of a large Midwestern company realized that an abrasive temperament threatened his career when his wife confided that similar behavior at home harmed their marriage
More dual-career couples also are getting help with men increasingly bringing their working wives for joint counseling
The level of stress for a woman is often so high it 's the husband who says I 'm worried about her says psychologist Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz
Her Institute for Family and Work Relationships in La Jolla Calif. has noted a doubling in the number of couples seeking help the past two years
No matter how competent and smart you both are the relationship almost certainly will erode if you do n't have time to talk to have fun and to be sexual says Ms. Shaevitz
She urges client couples to begin a detoxification period purging social and other nonproductive activities and setting time apart for themselves
Putting those times on the calendar she says is as important as remembering business appointments
Power of Suggestion Stronger in Japan HERE 'S ONE more explanation for why Japan is a tough industrial competitor Two of three Japanese employees submit suggestions to save money increase efficiency and boost morale while only 8 % of American workers do
And the Japanese make far more suggestions 2,472 per 100 eligible employees vs. only 13 per 100 employees in the Data for 1987 from the National Association of Suggestion Systems and the Japan Human Relations Association also indicate that Japanese employers adopt four of five suggestions while their U.S. counterparts accept just one in four
In Japan small suggestions are encouraged
Each new employee is expected to submit four daily in the first few months on the job
U.S. companies tend to favor suggestions that go for the home runs says Gary Floss vice president of corporate quality at Control Data Corp
That helps explain why American employers grant an average award of 604.72 per suggestion while Japan 's payment is 3.23
Still suggestions ' net savings per 100 employees is 274,475 in Japan vs. 24,891 in the U.S.
U.S. companies developing management teams are wrestling with how to handle individual suggestion systems
Control Data for one plays down its employee suggestion program because it favors the team-management focus
Merger Fallout Beware Employee Dishonesty CORPORATE security directors increasingly worry that merger mania spawns a rise in employee dishonesty
A Security magazine survey places the effect of takeovers and buy-outs among the industry 's 10 biggest challenges
If it causes management to take their eye off the ball inventory shrinkage is going to be affected says Lewis Shealy vice president for loss prevention at Marshall Field 's the department store chain
A separate study of the extent of employee misconduct linked general job satisfaction to property loss
Co-author Richard Hollinger cites what happened at one family-owned company absorbed by a foreign giant
Pilferage climbed dramatically as many angry employees felt abandoned by the former owners says the University of Florida sociologist
But top management should watch for other tell-tale signs of employee misdeeds like expense-account fudging and phone misuse
Security consultant Dennis Dalton of Ventura Calif. thinks mergers often trigger longer lunch hours and increased absenteeism conduct which can sap the bottom line more than thefts
New management can take several steps to reduce dishonesty
Most important experts say is to show that a company 's ethical tone is set at the top
Mr. Dalton also recommends that the chief executive establish a rumor control center and move swiftly to bolster morale
Consultant John Keller of Southlake Texas urges that top management adopt a tough hands-on approach with very tight controls and monitoring
And security authority Robert L. Duston favors disciplining all employees who cheat
Firms Walk Fine Line In Distributing Profits ARE CORPORATE profits distributed fairly A survey by Sirota Alper & Pfau a New York consulting firm underscores the difficulty for top management in satisfying employees and investors on that score
Nearly seven of 10 investors think companies reinvest too little of their profits in the business
And half the employees surveyed think companies dole out too little to them
But both see a common enemy About 66 % of employees and 73 % of investors think senior managers get too big a slice of the profit pie
Bank of New York Co. said it agreed in principle to acquire the credit-card business of Houston-based First City Bancorp. of Texas for between 130 million and 134 million
The move subject to a definitive agreement is part of a trend by big-city banks that have been buying up credit-card portfolios to expand their business
Just last month a Bank of New York subsidiary agreed to buy the credit-card operation of Dreyfus Corp. 's Dreyfus Consumer Bank for 168 million a transaction that is expected to be completed by the end of the year
First City 's portfolio includes approximately 640,000 accounts with about 550 million in loans outstanding
First City which issues both MasterCard and Visa cards has agreed to act as an agent bank
At the end of the third quarter Bank of New York 's credit-card business consisted of 2.4 million accounts with 3.6 billion in loans outstanding
Bank of New York is currently the seventh-largest issuer of credit cards in the First City said that because of increased competition in the credit-card business it had decided it either had to expand its own holdings substantially or sell them
We think there 's a good prospect that competition is going to get pretty fierce in this market said James E. Day a First City vice president
We see it becoming a bargain-basement kind of business
The company estimated that the transaction would enhance its book value which stood at 28.55 a share on Sept. 30 by more than 100 million or about 4 a share
The company also said the transaction would bolster after-tax earnings by 3.25 a share when completed and boost its primary capital ratio to 7 % from 6.63 %
First City which recently purchased three small Texas banking concerns said it would use the proceeds to pursue additional expansion opportunities in the Southwest and elsewhere
With that possibility in mind analysts said the transaction was a positive move for First City
I think they 'll be able to move faster to make acquisitions in Texas said Brent Erensel an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette
That 's something they can do very well
British Airways PLC said it is seeking improved terms and a sharply lower price in any revised bid for United Airlines parent UAL Corp. following the collapse of a 6.79 billion 300-a-share buy-out bid
Derek Stevens British Air 's chief financial officer told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report a price of 230 a share is certainly not too low and indicated his company would like to reduce the size of its 750 million cash investment
He added the airline is n't committed to going forward with any new bid and has n't participated in bankers ' efforts to revive the transaction that collapsed
We 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all
We 're not rushing into anything
We do n't want to be party to a second rejection he said adding that coming up with a revised offer could easily take several weeks
Mr. Stevens 's remarks confirming a report in The Wall Street Journal that British Air wants to start from scratch in any new bid for the nation 's second-largest airline helped push UAL stock lower for the fourth straight day
UAL fell 6.25 a share to 191.75 on volume of 2.3 million shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange as concern deepened among takeover stock traders about the length of time it will take to revive the purchase
Under the original buy-out approved by the UAL board Sept. 14 UAL 's pilots planned to put up 200 million in cash and make 200 million in annual cost concessions for a 75 % stake
UAL management was to pay 15 million for 10 % and British Air was to receive a 15 % stake
The buy-out fell through when Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing
Since then UAL stock has fallen 33 % in what may rank as the largest collapse of a takeover stock ever
The tenor of Mr. Stevens 's remarks seemed to indicate that British Air will take a more active high-profile role in pursuing any new bid
He said he believes UAL management was badly advised on the funding of its original transaction
Mr. Stevens said British Air has n't received any new buy-out proposals from the labor-management group led by UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and has n't received any indication of when one might be forthcoming
As far as we 're concerned we 're waiting for the dust to settle he said
Although British Air is waiting to see what the buy-out group comes up with Mr. Stevens said a revised transaction with less debt leverage is likely to be more attractive to banks
He said the original proposal is dead and all aspects of a revised version are up for change in light of the changes in UAL 's market price the amount of debt banks are willing to fund and the price British Air would be willing to pay
Mr. Stevens said he expects the new price will be considerably lower but declined to specify a figure
Asked whether a 230-a-share figure circulating in the market yesterday is too low he said It 's certainly not too low
He added the original offer was a pretty full price and that British Air 's contribution was quite a large chunk for us
British Air was originally attracted to the chance of obtaining a 15 % stake in the company but was n't particularly happy with paying 750 million
If the new deal had us putting up less money but still having 15 % that would be a point in our favor he said
In any new proposal British Air would expect a greater rate of return than the 20%-plus in the original proposal
In the event that the buy-out group stalls in reviving its bid the UAL board could remain under some pressure to seek another transaction even without any legal obligation to do so
Roughly one-third of its stock is believed held by takeover stock traders who could vote to oust the board if they become impatient
Meanwhile the buy-out group 's task of holding its fragile coalition together in the face of the bid 's collapse and internal opposition from two other employee groups has been further complicated by an apparent rift in the ranks of the pilot union itself
A pilot representing a group of 220 pilots hired during United 's 1985 strike filed suit Friday in Chicago federal court to block the takeover
The dissident pilots oppose the plan because it would cause them to lose their seniority
UAL 's management agreed to reduce the seniority of those pilots in exchange for the support of the United pilot union for the buy-out proposal
The 220 pilots involved in the suit are n't members of the union
The airline had allowed them to move ahead of some union members in seniority following the 1985 strike a move the union had contested in a previous lawsuit

Corporate efforts to control health-care costs by requiring evaluations prior to planned hospitalization and surgery have n't been sweeping enough to reduce the long-term rate of cost increases according to a study by the Institute of Medicine
In the last decade many corporations have embraced the utilization management cost containment strategy as a way to control health-care costs for employees
These programs vary widely but often require second opinions on proposed surgery preadmission reviews of elective hospitalizations and reviews of treatment during illnesses or recovery periods
Between 50 % and 75 % of today 's workers are covered by such plans up from 5 % five years ago
Although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers utilization management like most other cost containment strategies does n't appear to have altered the long-term rate of increase in health-care costs the Institute of Medicine an affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences concluded after a two-year study
Employers who saw a short-term moderation in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends
While utilization management frequently reduces hospitalization costs these savings are often offset by increases in outpatient services and higher administrative costs according to the report by a panel of health-care experts
The report suggested that current review programs are too narrow
The unnecessary and inappropriate use of the hospital and not the actual need for a particular procedure has been the main focus the panel said
As a general rule prior-review programs have not made case-by-case assessments of the comparative costs of alternative treatments or sites of care
The report said that utilization management should have more of an impact as federal research on the effectiveness of medical treatments helps lead to medical practice guidelines
Howard Bailit a panel member and a vice president of Aetna Life & Casualty said that utilization management will also do a better job of containing costs as it spreads to cover medical services delivered outside of hospitals
There 's pretty good evidence that utilization management has reduced inappropriate hospitalization he said
But at the same time spending on physician services and ambulatory care have mushroomed
It 's like squeezing a balloon Dr. Bailit said
David Rahill of A. Foster Higgins & Co. said that clients of his consulting firm report that utilization management reduces their hospital care bills by about 5 % but he agreed that for the health-care system as whole some of these savings are offset by administrative and outpatient care costs
Jerome Grossman chairman of the panel agrees that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high
You have a whole staff standing ready to evaluate the appropriateness of recommended treatment he said
Dr. Grossman who also is president of New England Medical Center Hospitals in Boston noted that the hospitals he runs deal with more than 100 utilization management firms and that many of them have different procedures and requirements
The panel urged greater efforts to reduce the complexity paperwork and cost of utilization review
Utilization management needs to better demonstrate that it reduces the wasteful use of resources improves the appropriateness of patient care and imposes only reasonable burdens on patients and providers the panel concluded
Renault and DAF Trucks NV announced a preliminary agreement to jointly manufacture a line of trucks in Britain and France
Philippe Gras a Renault managing director said the new line will cover trucks of between 2.5 tons and 4.2 tons and will be built at Renault 's Bapilly plant in France and at DAF 's British plant
The French state-controlled auto group and the Dutch truck maker plan to incorporate the new trucks into their product lines when they begin production toward the middle of the 1990s
Mr. Gras said he expects a definitive agreement between the two companies to be completed in the next few months
The venture is the latest example of the trend toward cooperative projects in Europe ahead of the 1992 deadline for eliminating trade barriers within the European Community
Renault and DAF are expected to invest a total of about three billion French francs 157.8 million in the venture including FFr 1 billion for design and development costs
In addition the companies will each spend about FFr 1 billion on tooling up their plants
Mr. Gras said the joint venture represents considerable savings for both Renault and DAF since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles
By pooling their resources the two groups have effectively halved the design and development costs that would otherwise have been entailed he said
Renault officials said the potential European market for light trucks in the 2.5-ton to 4.2-ton range is between 700,000 and 800,000 vehicles annually and Renault and DAF are aiming for a combined market share of about 11 %
Both Renault and DAF will have world-wide marketing rights for the new range of vans and light trucks
Under a separate arrangement British Aerospace PLC 's Rover Group PLC subsidiary will also be able to offer the vehicles through its dealers in the U.K. and Renault 's truck-building subsidiary Renault Vehicles Industriels will have similar rights in France
DAF is 16%-owned by British Aerospace with a further 6.5 % held by the Dutch state-owned chemical group NV DSM
The van Doorne family of the Netherlands holds an additional 11 % of DAF 's capital
The Federal Reserve System is the standard object of suggestions for organizational and institutional changes for two reasons
First its position in the government is anomalous
It has an unusual kind of independence from elected officials and still has authority over one of the most powerful of government 's instruments the control of the money supply
Thus we have a condition that is easily described as undemocratic
Second the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve as guardian of the currency which means as guardian of the stability of the price level sometimes lead it to take measures that are unpopular
As former Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin used to say they would have to take the punch bowl away just as the party is getting interesting
So the Federal Reserve is an attractive target for complaint by politicians
The Fed is easily assigned the blame for unpleasantness like high interest rates or slow economic growth while the politicians can escape responsibility by pointing to the Fed 's independence
This leads to proposals for reform of the Fed which have the common feature of making the Fed more responsive to the administration to the Congress and to public opinion without however any assumption of additional responsibility by the politicians
These proposals include changing the term of the chairman shortening the terms of the members eliminating the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks from the decision-making process putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Federal Reserve Board having the Fed audited by an arm of Congress the General Accounting Office putting the Fed 's expenditures in the budget and requiring prompt publication of the Fed 's minutes
Some of these ideas are again under consideration in Congress
But these proposals do not rest on a view of what the Fed 's problem is or if they do they rest on an incorrect view
They would not solve the problem they would make it worse
The problem is not that the Fed is too unresponsive to the public interest
On the contrary it is too responsive to an incorrect view of the public interest
The price level in the U.S. is now about 4 1\/4 times as high as it was 30 years ago
On average something that cost 100 30 years ago now costs 425
Or a wage that was 100 30 years ago would buy only 23.53 worth of stuff today
On two occasions the inflation rate rose to more than 10 % a year
In each case the ending of this unsustainable inflation caused a severe recession the two worst of the postwar period
The enormous inflation over the past 30 years was largely due to monetary policy
At least it would not have happened without the support of monetary policy that provided for a 10-fold increase in the money supply during the same period
And that increase in the money supply would not have happened without the consent of the Federal Reserve
The basic problem of monetary policy to which reform of the Fed should be addressed is to prevent a recurrence of this experience
There were two general reasons for the mistaken monetary policy of the past 30 years 1
To some extent the Federal Reserve shared the popular but incorrect view that expansionary monetary policy could yield a net improvement in employment and output
2
Even where the Fed did not share this view it felt the need to accommodate to it
Despite all the formal provisions for its independence the Fed seems constantly to feel that if it uses its independence too freely it will lose it
The common proposals for reforming the Fed would only make the situation worse if they had any effect at all
Putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Board of Governors one of the leading proposals today is an example
The secretary is the world 's biggest borrower of money
He has a built-in constant longing for lower interest rates
Moreover he is a political agent of a political president who naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way the economy will perform before the next election and less to its longer-run health
These days the secretary suffers the further disqualification that he is a member of a club of seven finance ministers who meet occasionally to decide what exchange rates should be which is a diversion from the real business of the Federal Reserve to stabilize the price level
How should a reasonable member of the Federal Reserve Board interpret a congressional decision to put the secretary on the board Could he plausibly interpret it as encouragement for the Fed to give primary emphasis to stabilizing the price level Or would he interpret it as instruction to give more weight to these other objectives that the secretary represents low interest rates short-run economic expansion and stabilization of exchange rates at internationally managed levels The answer seems perfectly clear
True a succession of Fed chairmen has given color to the notion that the Secretary of the Treasury belongs on the Fed
By their constant readiness to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are ingredients of a common stew in which case it is natural that the Fed and the Treasury and probably also the Congress should be jointly engaged in stirring the pot
The Fed 's case for its own independence would be a little stronger if it were more solicitous of the independence of the rest of the government
The Fed 's problem is not that it is too independent or too unpolitical
The Fed is responsive to and can not help being responsive to the more overtly political part of the government
The Fed exercises a power given to it by Congress and the president
But Congress and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they have given the Fed
Critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is undemocratic
What is undemocratic is the unwillingness of the more political parts of the government to take the responsibility for deciding the basic question of monetary policy which is what priority should be given to stabilizing the price level
To leave this decision to an independent agency is not only undemocratic
It also prevents the conduct of a policy that has a long-term rationale because it leaves the Fed guessing about what are the expectations of its masters the politicians who have never had to consider the long-term consequences of monetary policy
The greatest contribution Congress could make at this time would be to declare that stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the Federal Reserve System
Legislation to this effect has been introduced in Congress in this session by Rep. Stephen Neal D. N.C

It is not the kind of thing that is likely to be enacted however
Congress would be required to make a hard decision and Congress would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the Fed and retain its rights of complaint after the fact
People will say that the nation and the government have other objectives in addition to stabilizing the price level which is true
But that is not the same as saying that the Federal Reserve has other objectives
The government has other agencies and instruments for pursuing these other objectives
But it has only the Fed to pursue price-level stability
And the Fed has at most very limited ability to contribute to the achievement of other objectives by means other than by stabilizing the price level
The two objectives most commonly thought to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the Fed are high employment and rapid real growth
But the main lesson of economic policy in the past 30 years is that if the Fed compromises with the price-stability objective in the pursuit of these other goals the result is not high employment and rapid growth but is inflation

Republic New York Corp. joined the list of banks boosting reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries setting out a 200 million provision and posting a 155.4 million third-quarter net loss as a result
The per-share loss was 5.32
In the year earlier period the New York parent of Republic National Bank had net income of 38.7 million or 1.12 a share
Excluding the provision Republic earned 44.6 million up 15 % from a year ago
The bank 's medium-term and long-term loans to less-developed countries total 293 million of which 146 million are n't accruing interest the bank said
Republic 's total of nonperforming assets was 167 million at Sept. 30 with its reserve for loan losses now standing at 357 million
Abortion-rights advocates won last week 's battles but the war over the nation 's most-contentious social question is about to pick up again on turf that favors those seeking to restrict abortions
Strict new regulations seem certain to pass the state House in Pennsylvania next week with easy approval by the Senate and by Democratic Gov. Bob Casey expected shortly thereafter
Legislation to require the consent of parents before their daughters under the age of 18 can have abortions will probably pass both houses of the Michigan legislature and set up a grinding battle to override the expected veto of Democratic Gov. James Blanchard
The short-term shift in the political climate surrounding abortion reflects two factors that are likely to govern the debate in the next several months the reawakening of the abortion-rights movement as a potent force after years of lassitude and the ability of each side to counter the other 's advance in one arena with a victory of its own elsewhere
The action in Pennsylvania for example will follow last week 's collapse of a special session of the Florida legislature to enact restrictions on abortions in that state and the vote here in Washington by the House to permit federally paid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest
But President Bush is expected to veto the congressional legislation and that along with the easy approval of the Pennsylvania measure is likely to mute the abortion-rights activists ' claims of momentum and underline the challenges faced by this resurgent movement
It 's great to feel good for once in 15 years says Harrison Hickman a consultant to abortion-rights advocates reflecting the relief of his compatriots after last week 's victories the first major events since the Supreme Court in its July 3 Webster decision permitted the states to enact restrictions on abortions
But how many more times we 're going to feel good in the next 15 is another question
Indeed abortion-rights activists still face their greatest tests
The pro-choice movement has shown finally that it can mobilize says Glen Halva-Neubauer a Furman University political scientist who specializes in how state legislators handle the abortion question
But it still has n't shown that it can win in a state like Pennsylvania or Missouri where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue and where it 's been an emotional issue for a long time
The foes of abortion hold the strong whip hand in Pennsylvania where abortion-rights activists are so much on the defensive that their strategy is less to fight the proposed legislation than it is to stress how the state legislature does n't reflect the viewpoints of the state 's citizens
As a result GOP state Rep. Stephen Freind of Delaware County the legislature 's leading foe of abortion has been given all but free rein to press a strict seven-point plan to restrict abortion and he hopes to force the Supreme Court directly to reassess its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established the right of abortion in the first place
The Freind legislation the state 's House Judiciary Committee approved it in Harrisburg this week and the full Pennsylvania House is expected to take up the bill next Tuesday includes a provision to ban abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy except to avert the death of the mother
Mr. Freind calculates that the provision which attacks the trimester standards that Roe established will make it necessary for the Supreme Court to review Roe and perhaps to overturn it
But the Pennsylvania measure also includes an informed consent provision that may become widely imitated by abortion foes who want to make women contemplating abortion as uncomfortable as possible with the procedure and with themselves
Under this legislation a woman must be informed 24 hours before the operation of the details of the procedure and its risks
Regardless of whether one supports or opposes the right to an abortion Mr. Freind argues it is virtually impossible for any rational human being to disagree with the concept that a woman has the right to have all of the appropriate materials and advice made available to her before she makes a decision which one way or the other might remain with her for the rest of her life
In Michigan where the state Senate is expected to approve parental-consent legislation by the end of next week Gov. Blanchard is the principal obstacle for anti-abortionists
Susan Rogin a consultant to abortion-rights activists in the state takes comfort from the fact that the state 's House abortion opponents have n't been able to muster the votes to overturn a veto on abortion in 16 years
But proponents believe they may be able to shake enough votes loose to override the veto if they are successful in portraying the legislation as a matter of parents ' rights
In Illinois lawmakers will vote before next spring on legislation requiring physicians to perform tests on fetuses at 20 weeks to determine their gestational age weight and lung maturity along with a provision requiring that if fetuses survive an abortion a second doctor must be on hand to help it survive
The legislation failed by one vote to clear the House Rules Committee Tuesday but anti-abortionists still may succeed in bringing the measure to the floor this fall
Pamela Sutherland executive director of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council says she and her allies are cautiously optimistic they can defeat it if it comes to a floor vote
Abortion foes in Wisconsin meanwhile expect a parental-consent bill to be sent to the state assembly floor by early November and are hopeful of prevailing in both houses by next March
In Texas abortion opponents want to pass parental-consent legislation along with a statewide ban on the use of public funds personnel and facilities for abortion and viability tests for fetuses 19 weeks and older
The anti-abortionists are urging GOP Gov. Bill Clements to press the issues in a special session scheduled to run Nov. 14 to Dec. 13
The prognosis is only fair says Kathie Roberts administrative director of the Texas Right to Life Committee
Next year is an election year and the legislators just do n't want to do anything about this now
This legislative activity comes as both sides are undertaking new mobilization efforts plunging into gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey and girding for next autumn 's state elections
At the same time abortion foes have developed a national legislative strategy deciding to move on what Jacki Ragan the National Right to Life Committee 's director of state organizational development calls reasonable measures that an overwhelming mainstream majority of Americans support
These include bans on the use of abortion for birth control and sex selection and the public funding of alternatives for abortion
Those who are on the other side can hardly oppose alternative funding if they continue to insist on calling themselves pro-choice rather than pro-abortion says Mary Spaulding the group 's associate state legislative coordinator
Over the weekend the National Abortion Rights Action League singled out eight politicians including Pennsylvania 's Mr. Freind as 1990 targets and held a Washington seminar designed to train its leaders in political techniques including how to put the anti-abortionists on the defensive in state legislatures
We now see pro-choice legislators going on the offensive for the first time says Kate Michelman executive director of the group

Congress sent President Bush an 18.4 billion fiscal 1990 Treasury and Postal Service bill providing 5.5 billion for the Internal Revenue Service and increasing the Customs Service 's air-interdiction program nearly a third
Final approval came on a simple voice vote in the Senate and the swift passage contrasted with months of negotiations over the underlying bill which is laced with special-interest provisions for both members and the executive branch

In a separate development a private meeting is scheduled this morning between House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten D. Miss
and Sen. Dale Bumpers D. Ark
in an effort to end a dispute which for two weeks has delayed action on an estimated 44 billion agriculture bill
A House-Senate conference reached agreement Oct. 5 on virtually all major provisions of the bill but final settlement has been stalled because of differences between the two men over the fate of a modest Arkansas-based program to provide technical information to farmers seeking to reduce their dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides
The program 's nonprofit sponsors received 900,000 in fiscal 1989 through an Extension Service grant but Mr. Whitten has been adamant in insisting that the program be cut in 1990
The 79-year-old Mississippian takes a more orthodox entrenched view of agriculture policy than those in the movement to reduce chemical use but as a master of pork-barrel politics he is believed to be annoyed as well that the project moved to Arkansas from a Tennessee center near Memphis and the northern Mississippi border

B.A.T Industries PLC may delay aspects of its defensive restructuring plan including the sale of its Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field units in the wake of the current upheaval in financial markets company officials said
The British conglomerate planning its own defensive restructuring to fight off a 13.35 billion 21.03 billion takeover bid by Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith intends to press ahead with an extraordinary shareholder vote today to clear the way for its value-boosting measures
If anything the gyrations in world stock markets and in B.A.T 's share price since last Friday 's sharp Wall Street sell-off have increased the likelihood of shareholder approval for the restructuring analysts and several big institutional holders said
Thank God we have some deal on the table said Stewart Gilchrist a director at Scottish Amicable Investment Managers which intends to vote its roughly 1 % stake in favor of the restructuring
Investors in B.A.T have been on a roller coaster
B.A.T has been London 's best-performing blue chip over the past six months up 40 % against a 4 % rise in the Financial Times 100-Share Index
But this week B.A.T has been hit harder than other big U.K. stocks first by the market gyrations then by Tuesday 's San Francisco earthquake which could leave B.A.T 's Farmers Group Inc. insurance unit facing big claims
B.A.T rose five pence eight cents to 756 pence 11.91 in London yesterday as a late market rally erased a 28-pence fall earlier in the day
To fight off predators B.A.T plans to spin off about 6 billion in assets largely by selling such U.S. retailing units as Marshall Field and Saks and by floating its big paper and U.K. retailing business via share issues to existing holders
Proceeds will help pay for a planned buy-back of 10 % of its shares and a 50 % dividend increase
I think the restructuring will get the required support said Michael Pacitti an analyst at London stockbroker UBS Phillips & Drew
The shareholders effectively will support the share price by clearing the share buy-back
But B.A.T 's restructuring which was never going to happen quickly now will take longer because of the market upheaval
Company officials holders and analysts who previously expected the disposals to be substantially complete by the end of next year 's first half now say the market gyrations could delay the actions well into the second half
We are n't forced sellers
We do n't have an absolute deadline and if market conditions are truly awful we might decide it is not the right time to take particular steps said Michael Prideaux a B.A.T spokesman
Even if B.A.T receives approval for the restructuring the company will remain in play say shareholders and analysts though the situation may unfold over the next 12 months rather than six
The new B.A.T will be a smaller tobacco and financial-services hybrid whose price-earnings ratio may more closely reflect the lower-growth tobacco business than the higher-multiple financial-services business these holders believe
Thus B.A.T 's restructuring may only make the company a more manageable target for other corporate predators possibly such acquisitive bidders as Hanson PLC
The last few days will surely slow down the pace of events says Scottish Amicable 's Mr. Gilchrist
But I would n't write off Sir James or other potential bidders
Among possible delays the sales of Saks and Marshall Field which were expected to be on the block soon after the crucial Christmas season may slide into the second quarter or second half
Analysts estimate that sales of the two businesses could raise roughly 2 billion
B.A.T is n't predicting a postponement because the units are quality businesses and we are encouraged by the breadth of inquiries said Mr. Prideaux
But the delay could happen if B.A.T does n't get adequate bids he said
People familiar with B.A.T say possible acquirers for the units include managers from both retailing chains and General Cinema Corp. which is interested in bidding for Saks
Other potential bidders for parts of B.A.T 's U.S. retail unit include Dillard Department Stores Inc. May Department Stores Co. and Limited Inc
B.A.T has declined to identify the potential bidders
Though Sir James has said he intends to mount a new bid for B.A.T once approval from U.S. insurance regulators is received jitters over prospects for junk-bond financing and U.S. leverage buy-outs are making investors more skeptical about Sir James 's prospects
His initial offer indicated he needed to raise as much as 80 % of the takeover financing through the debt markets
Market uncertainty also clouds the outlook for B.A.T 's attracting a premium price for its U.S. retailing properties
Finally Tuesday 's California earthquake initially knocked 3.7 % off B.A.T 's share price in London yesterday because of fears of the potential claims to Los Angeles-based Farmers which has a substantial portion of its property and casualty exposure in California
On Farmers Mr. Prideaux said it is too early to quantify the level of potential claims
He added B.A.T has no expectation of a material impact on Farmers
Bridge and highway collapses will disrupt truck and auto transportation in the San Francisco Bay area for months to come
But rail air and ocean-shipping links to the area escaped Tuesday 's earthquake with only minor damage and many are expected to be operating normally today government and corporate transport officials said
Air traffic at San Francisco International Airport was running about 50 % of normal yesterday afternoon but airport officals said they expect a return to full operations by Saturday
The major gateway to Asia and one of the nation 's 10 busiest airports was closed to all but emergency traffic from the time the quake hit Tuesday afternoon until 6 a.m. PDT yesterday when controllers returned to the tower
Getting to and from the airport in coming weeks may be the problem however
People 's ability to drive throughout the bay area is greatly restricted said a spokesman for the American Automobile Association
Tom Schumacher executive vice president and general manager of the California Trucking Association in Sacremento said his organization urged trucking firms to halt all deliveries into the Bay area yesterday except for emergency-medical supplies
Some foodstuff shipments will probably resume Thursday he said
Right now most of the roads into the Bay area are closed but the list of closings changes about every 20 minutes
This Wednesday morning the San Mateo bridge was open and now we are informed that it is closed Mr. Schumacher said
United Parcel Service Greenwich Conn. said its operations in the San Francisco area have been reduced to 40 % of normal
A UPS spokesman said that although none of the company 's terminals trucks or airplanes were damaged in the quake road shutdowns and power failures have impeded its pickup and delivery of packages
The spokesman noted four-hour to five-hour traffic delays on the San Mateo bridge for example
In addition power failures prevented its package-sorting facilities from operating causing delays
But freight railroads reported that damage to their facilities was relatively minor with Santa Fe Pacific Corp. 's rail unit the least affected by the quake
Santa Fe stopped freight trains Tuesday night while its officials inspected track but resumed service at 10:45 p.m. when they found no damage
Union Pacific Corp. 's rail unit said that except for damage to shipping containers in its Oakland yard its track bridges and structures were unharmed
That railroad is operating trains but with delays caused by employees unable to get to work
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. the hardest hit of the three railroads in the Bay area said service on its north-south coastline which is used by an Amtrak train between Los Angeles and Seattle was suspended temporarily because of kinked rails near the epicenter of the quake
But service on the line is expected to resume by noon today
We had no serious damage on the railroad said a Southern Pacific spokesman
We have no problem to our freight service at all expect for the fact businesses are shut down
Amtrak said it suspended train service into its Oakland station which sustained heavy structural damage during the quake
The passenger railroad said it terminated some runs in Sacramento relying on buses to ferry passengers to the Bay area
Amtrak said it planned to resume some train operations to Oakland late yesterday
Rail-transit operations suffered little damage according to Albert Engelken deputy executive director of the American Public Transit Association in Washington
The Bay Area Rapid Transit withstood the earthquake perfectly said Mr. Engelken adding that the rail system was running a full fleet of 45 trains during the day to provide an alternative for highway travelers
The highway system is screwed up by the earthquake Mr. Engelken said
The transit system is how people are going to be getting around
He added that San Francisco 's trolley cars and trolley buses were also running at full service levels
Although air-traffic delays in San Francisco were significant yesterday they did n't appear to spread to other airports
The earthquake shattered windows at San Francisco International 's air-traffic control tower and rained pieces of the ceiling down on controllers three of whom suffered minor injuries
Terminals at San Francisco International also were damaged but the tower itself was intact
Tuesday night thousands were diverted to other airports and had to wait a day to resume travel
Runways at San Francisco were n't damaged but traffic was being limited yesterday to 27 arrivals and 27 departures an hour down from 33 to 45 an hour normally mainly because the noise level in the control tower was overwhelming without the windows an FAA spokeswoman said
While the airport was closed flights were diverted to airports in Sacramento and Stockton Calif. Reno and Las Vegas Nev. and Los Angeles
United Airlines the largest carrier at San Francisco was operating only 50 % of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to the Bay area
A United spokesman said 14 of its 21 gates were unusable mainly because of water damage caused when a sprinkler system was triggered by the tremors
The United spokesman said none of its people were injured at the airport in fact as the airport was being evacuated Tuesday night two babies were born
Yesterday the United ticket counter was active with people trying to get flights out but the airline said demand for seats into the city also was active with people trying to get there to help family and friends
The airports in San Jose and Oakland were both fully operational by noon yesterday the Federal Aviation Administration said
In terms of diversions Denver 's Stapleton International may have experienced the most far-flung A United flight from Japan was rerouted there
I think that 's the first nonstop commercial passenger flight from Japan to land here an airport spokesman said
A Japan Air Lines spokesman said its flights into and out of San Francisco were n't affected but getting information about its operations was difficult
Its telecommunications headquarters in Burlingame Calif. had been knocked out since the quake
We 're in the dark he said
Whitbread & Co. put its spirits division up for sale triggering a scramble among global groups for the British company 's brands
Whitbread already has been approached by about half a dozen companies interested in buying all or part of the spirits business a spokesman said
Analysts expect the spirits operations and some California vineyards that also are being sold to fetch about 500 million 788.8 million
Among the brands for sale are Beefeater gin the No. 2 imported gin in the U.S. and Laphroaig single-malt whiskey
Also for sale are Buckingham Wile Co. which distributes Cutty Sark blended whiskey in the U.S. and Whitbread 's Atlas Peak Vineyards in California 's Napa Valley
Beefeater alone is worth as much as 300 million analysts said
Whitbread bought the Beefeater distillery two years ago for 174.5 million
That purchase represented an attempt by Whitbread a venerable British brewer to become a major player in the global liquor business
But Whitbread has been squeezed by giant rivals amid widespread consolidation in the industry
Now it wants to concentrate on beer and its newer hotel and restaurant operations
For rival liquor companies the Whitbread auction is a rare opportunity to acquire valuable brands
It 's not very often something like this comes up said Ron Littleboy a liquor company analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London
The division will be sold off quite rapidly predicted Neill Junor an analyst at London brokers County NatWest WoodMac
Among possible buyers Grand Metropolitan PLC might find Beefeater a useful addition to its portfolio
Grand Met owns Bombay gin the No. 3 imported gin in the U.S. rival Guinness PLC has the No. 1 imported brand Tanqueray
The Whitbread spirits auction is an extremely interesting development and naturally we 'll be considering it carefully a Grand Met spokesman said
Guinness which owns several leading whiskey brands plus Gordon 's gin the world 's No. 1 gin is considered less likely to bid for the Whitbread spirits
A Guinness spokesman declined to comment
Two other global liquor giants Canada 's Seagram Co. and Britain 's Allied-Lyons PLC also are possible buyers
Seagram 's gin is the world 's No. 2 gin brand but the company does n't own any of the major gin brands imported in the U.S.
Allied-Lyons while powerful in whiskey does n't own any major white-spirit brands
We will certainly have to take a look at the Whitbread spirits business an Allied-Lyons spokesman said
We would certainly like to have a major white-spirits brand in our portfolio
A Seagram spokesman in New York would n't comment
Smaller liquor companies such as Brown-Forman Corp. and American Brands Inc. of the U.S. also are likely to be interested
Such companies are increasingly being left behind in the global liquor business says Nomura 's Mr. Littleboy
In New York a spokesman for American Brands would n't comment
Brown-Forman a Louisville Ky. distiller also declined to comment
Whitbread 's wine spirits and soft-drink operations had trading profit of 35.4 million on sales of 315.5 million in the year ended Feb. 25
The company which is retaining most of its wine and all of its soft-drink interests did n't break out results for the businesses it plans to sell
But analysts estimate their trading profit at 30 million
Whitbread had total pretax profit in the year ended Feb. 25 of 223.2 million on sales of 2.26 billion
Whitbread 's spirits auction occurs amid a parallel shakeup in the British beer industry
Earlier this year the government announced plans to foster increased competition in the industry
British brewers currently own thousands of pubs which in turn sell only the breweries ' beer and soft drinks
Under new rules many of the country 's pubs would become free houses selling beers of their choice
Whitbread now intends to bolster its brewing interests in an effort to grab a share of sales to free houses
The company which last month paid 50.7 million for regional British brewer Boddington Group PLC has about 13 % of the British beer market
Whitbread also owns the license to brew and distribute Heineken and Stella Artois beers in Britain
In addition Whitbread intends to focus on its newer hotel liquor store and restaurant businesses in Europe and North America
In Britain those interests include the Beefeater steakhouse chain and joint ownership with PepsiCo Inc. of the country 's Pizza Hut chain
In Canada and the U.S. Whitbread owns The Keg chain of steak and seafood restaurants
Focusing on beer restaurants and hotels means we can concentrate our skills and resources more effectively Peter Jarvis Whitbread 's managing director said in a statement
The spirits business would require substantial additional investment to enable it to compete effectively in the first division of global players
Whitbread also announced that Mr. Jarvis who is 48 will become the company 's chief executive March 1
At that time Sam Whitbread the company 's chairman and a descendant of its 18th-century founder will retire from executive duties
He will retain the honorary title of non-executive chairman

Both distributions are payable Dec. 4 to limited partners of record Nov. 3
Mellon Bank Corp. said directors authorized the buy-back of as many as 250,000 common shares
The bank holding company said stock repurchased will be used to meet requirements for the company 's benefit plans
Mellon has 36.6 million shares outstanding
Champion International Corp. 's third-quarter profit dropped 17 % reflecting price declines for certain paper products operating problems at certain mills and other factors
The paper producer reported that net income fell to 102.1 million or 1.09 a share from 122.4 million or 1.29 a share in the year-earlier period
Sales rose 2.6 % to 1.32 billion from 1.29 billion
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Champion 's shares rose 25 cents to 32.125
Digital Equipment Corp. is planning a big coming-out party on Tuesday for its first line of mainframe computers
But an uninvited guest is expected to try to crash the party
On the morning of the long-planned announcement International Business Machines Corp. is to introduce its own new mainframe
Their attitude is You want to talk mainframes we 'll talk mainframes says one computer industry executive
They 're deliberately trying to steal our thunder a Digital executive complains
Maybe we should take it as a compliment
Digital 's target is the 40 billion market for mainframe computers the closet-sized number-crunchers that nearly every big company needs to run its business
IBM based in Armonk N.Y. has dominated the market for decades
That does n't scare Digital which has grown to be the world 's second-largest computer maker by poaching customers of IBM 's mid-range machines
Digital based in Maynard Mass. hopes to stage a repeat performance in mainframes and it has spent almost 1 billion developing the new technology
A spoiler nimble Tandem Computers Inc. in Cupertino Calif. jumped into the fray earlier this week with an aggressively priced entry
IBM appears more worried about Digital which has a broad base of customers waiting for the new line dubbed the VAX 9000
It 's going to be nuclear war says Thomas Willmott a consultant with Aberdeen Group Inc
The surge in competition is expected to stir new life into the huge mainframe market where growth has slowed to single digits in recent years
IBM 's traditional mainframe rivals including Unisys Corp. Control Data Corp. and NCR Corp. have struggled recently
Digital is promising a new approach
Robert M. Glorioso Digital 's vice president for high performance systems says Digital 's mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything revolves but as part of a decentralized network weaving together hundreds of workstations personal computers printers and other devices
And unlike IBM 's water-cooled mainframes it does n't need any plumbing
The challengers will have a big price advantage
Digital is expected to tag its new line from about 1.24 million to 4.4 million and up depending on configuration
That 's about half the price of comparably equipped IBM mainframes
Tandem 's pricing is just as aggressive
The heightened competition will hit IBM at a difficult time
The computer giant 's current mainframe line which has sold well and has huge profit margins is starting to show its age
The new 3090s due next week will boost performance by only about 8 % to 10 %
And IBM is n't expected to deliver a new generation of mainframes until 1991
Still no one expects IBM 's rivals to deliver a knockout
IBM has a near-monopoly on mainframes with an estimated 70 % share of the market
IBM is five times the size of Digital and 40 times the size of Tandem and wields enormous market power
It counts among its customers a majority of the world 's largest corporations which entrust their most critical business information to IBM computers
We 're not going to walk in and replace a company 's corporate accounting system if it 's already running on an IBM mainframe concedes Kenneth H. Olsen Digital 's president
He says Digital will target faster-growing market segments such as on-line transaction processing which includes retail-sales tracking airline reservations and bank-teller networks
Tandem which already specializes in on-line transaction processing is a potent competitor in that market
A key marketing target for Digital will be the large number of big customers who already own both Digital and IBM systems
One such company is Bankers Trust Co
Stanley Rose a vice president technological and strategic planning at Bankers Trust says that despite Digital 's low prices we are n't about to unplug our IBM mainframes for a DEC machine
The software conversion costs would dwarf any savings
But Mr. Rose is still looking seriously at the 9000
Bankers Trust uses Digital 's VAX to run its huge money-transfer and capital markets accounts juggling hundreds of billions of dollars each day he says
As that system grows larger computers may be needed
In the past customers had to go to IBM when they outgrew the VAX
Now they do n't have to he says
That 's going to cost IBM revenue
Analysts say Digital can expect this pent-up demand for the new VAX to fuel strong sales next year
Barry F. Willman an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. estimates the 9000 could boost sales by more than 1 billion in the fiscal year beginning in July
He bases the estimate on a survey of hundreds of Digital 's largest customers
Although Digital will announce a full family of mainframes next week it is n't expected to begin shipping in volume until next year
The first model available will be the 210 which is likely to appeal to many technical and scientific buyers interested in the optional super-charger or vector processor says Terry Shannon of International Data Corp. a market research concern
Four more models aimed squarely at IBM 's commercial customers are expected to begin shipping in late June
Most analysts do n't expect the new mainframes to begin contributing significantly to revenue before the fiscal first quarter which begins next July 1
Digital 's new line has been a long time coming
The company has long struggled to deliver a strong mainframe-class product and made a costly decision in 1988 to halt development of an interim product meant to stem the revenue losses at the high end
Digital 's failure to deliver a true mainframe-class machine before now may have cost the company as much as 1 billion in revenue in fiscal 1989 Mr. Willman says
IBM will face still more competition in coming months
Amdahl Corp. backed by Japan 's Fujitsu Ltd. has a growing share of the market with its low-priced IBM-compatible machines

But when stocks held steady Treasury bonds later retreated
Speculation that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in coming weeks helped push the dollar down while boosting stocks traders said
But many investors remain wary about stocks partly because they expect continued turbulence in the junk-bond market that would make it more difficult to finance corporate takeovers
I 'm surprised we did n't see more volatility in stocks said Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker
I think the problems in the junk-bond area are just beginning and this will be very unsettling for companies that have issued junk bonds
In a bull market credit does not matter Mr. DeVoe added
But when it does matter then it 's the only thing that matters
However many institutional investors are reacting to the stock market 's plunge as a great buying opportunity said Charles I. Clough chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
Things are beginning to settle down
The markets are returning to normalcy
Oil prices initially rose on fears that the massive earthquake in Northern California would disrupt production
But prices later reversed course finishing slightly lower as investors concluded that any cuts would n't be large and that foreign oil producers would quickly pick up the slack
In major market activity Stock prices rose
New York Stock Exchange volume shrank to 166.9 million shares from 224.1 million Tuesday
Advancers on the Big Board outpaced decliners by 822 to 668
Bond prices were little changed in sluggish activity
The yield on the Treasury 's 30-year issue fell slightly to 8.03 %
The dollar dropped
In New York late yesterday the currency was at 141.45 yen and 1.8485 marks down from 142.75 yen and 1.8667 marks late Tuesday
James L. Madson 46 years old was named a vice president and assistant general manager of this producer of copper and other minerals
He will succeed Arthur E. Himebaugh as general manager Feb. 1 when Mr. Himebaugh retires
AMR Corp. posted an 8.8 % drop in third-quarter net income and said the fourth quarter will be disappointing as well primarily because of slimmer profit margins and increased fuel costs
AMR 's earnings decline comes a year after the parent company of American Airlines and the rest of the airline industry set profit records
Some analysts say the latest results only seem pale by comparison with a spectacular second half of 1988
Still AMR 's stumble does n't bode well for the rest of the industry
The Fort Worth Texas company is generally regarded as one of the best-run in the business and its difficulties are likely to be reflected industrywide as other major carriers report third-quarter results over the next several days
Meanwhile the company 's board which had said nothing publicly about investor Donald Trump 's recently withdrawn 7.5 billion offer for AMR issued a statement condemning ill-conceived and reckless bids and saying it was pleased that Mr. Trump had backed out
In the third quarter AMR said net fell to 137 million or 2.16 a share from 150.3 million or 2.50 a share
Revenue rose 17 % to 2.73 billion from 2.33 billion a year earlier
AMR 's chairman Robert L. Crandall said the results were due to an 11 % year-to-year increase in fuel prices and a slight decrease in yield an industry measure analogous to profit margin on each seat sold
We think these trends will continue and will produce a very disappointing fourth quarter as well he said
Tim Pettee an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co. said The business turned faster than expected
Costs are giving them a little bit of trouble and the whole industry is having a pricing problem
For the nine months AMR 's net rose 15 % to 415.9 million or 6.59 a share from 360.1 million or 5.99 a share
Revenue jumped 22 % to 7.89 billion from 6.46 billion
AMR 's board in a statement after a regular meeting yesterday said Ill-considered and reckless acquisition proposals adversely affect employee financial and business relationships and are contrary to the best interests of AMR shareholders
AMR has not been and is not for sale
Mr. Crandall said the company 's current decline in earnings is exactly the kind of situation that an excessively leveraged company laden with debt from a takeover would find difficult to weather
Our very disappointing third-quarter results and the discouraging outlook for the fourth quarter underscore the importance of an adequate capital base he said

Without federal subsidies to developers of beach houses the economic and structural damage by Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina would have been much less as highlighted by your Oct. 3 editorial Subsidizing Disaster
Congress should stop throwing tax dollars out to sea by subsidizing the development of beach communities on ecologically fragile coastal barrier islands such as the hard-hit Isle of Palms near Charleston
As you mentioned subsidies for development on a number of barrier islands were curtailed in 1982 by the Coastal Barrier Resource System
The National Taxpayers Union would like Congress to add 800,000 acres to the 453,000 of shoreline in the system by enacting The Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1989
This bill simply says that if you want to develop property on a barrier island you have to do so without taxpayer support
Private-property rights would be upheld because the legislation would not ban coastal development
However home builders would have to bear the full costs of such beach-house construction
A Taxpayers Union study concluded the bill would save taxpayers up to 9.3 billion in barrier-island subsidies over 20 years
Already the 1982 legislation has saved an estimated 800 million
Marshall Y. Taylor Communications Director National Taxpayers Union The government said 13.1 % of Americans or 31.9 million people were living in poverty in 1988
While last year 's figure was down from 13.4 % in 1987 and marked the fifth consecutive annual decline in the poverty rate the Census Bureau said the 1988 drop was n't statistically significant
The bureau 's report also showed that while some measures of the nation 's economic well-being improved modestly in 1988 the fruits of prosperity were shared less equitably than the year before
Summarizing data derived from a March 1989 survey of 58,000 households William Butz associate director of the Census Bureau said that most groups either stayed the same or improved
But he added Since the late 1960s the distribution of income has been slowly getting less equal
There was no reversal of that trend between 1987 and 1988
Per capita income a widely used measure of a nation 's economic health hit a record in 1988 rising 1.7 % after inflation adjustment to 13,120
But the median income of American families fell 0.2 % the first time it has failed to rise since 1982
Mr. Butz said the divergence in the two measures reflects changes in family size and structure including the rising number of female-headed families and a sharp increase in income reported by Americans who are n't living in families
As a result of last year 's decline the government 's estimate for the number of people living below the poverty line declined by about 500,000
The poverty threshold defined as three times food expenses as calculated by the Agricultural Department last year was 12,092 for a family of four
The Census Bureau counts all cash income in determining whether families are below the line but it does n't consider other government benefits such as Medicare
Thanks largely to the continued growth of the U.S. economy the poverty rate is now substantially lower than the 1983 peak of 15.3 % but the improvements have been modest in the past couple of years
Poverty remains far more widespread among blacks than other Americans
In 1988 31.6 % of blacks lived in poverty compared with 10.1 % for whites and 26.8 % for Hispanics
But two-thirds of all poor Americans were white
More than half of poor families were headed by women living without men the bureau said
More than three-fourths of poor black families were headed by women
The poverty rate of children under 18 years old dropped last year to 19.7 % from 20.5 % in 1987 but remained far higher than a decade ago
The rate among the elderly 12 % in 1988 was n't significantly lower than the year before
If it were n't for Social Security payments more than three times as many elderly would be below the poverty line Mr. Butz said
The Census Bureau also said Some 17.2 % of all money income received by families in 1988 went to the wealthiest 5 % of all families up from 16.9 % in 1987
That is the greatest share reported for any year since 1950 although changing definitions over the years distort the comparison
The top fifth of all families got 44 % of the income up from 41.5 % a decade earlier
The bottom fifth of all families got 4.6 % of the income down from 5.2 % a decade earlier
Confirming other government data showing that wages are n't keeping pace with inflation earnings of year-round full-time male workers fell 1.3 % in 1988 after adjusting for higher prices the first such drop since 1982
Earnings of female workers were unchanged
Women working full-time earned 66 cents for every dollar earned by men a penny more than in 1987 and seven cents more than in 1978
Median household income which includes both those living in families and those who are n't rose 0.3 % last year to 27,225 after inflation
It rose sharply in the Northeast and Midwest and fell slightly in the South and West
Median family income was 32,191 down 0.2 %
Per capita income of blacks though still only 60 % that of whites rose 3.9 % in 1988 while per capita income of whites rose only 1.5 %
Among married couples the gap between blacks and whites narrowed sharply as income of black families shot up 6.8 % while income of whites did n't budge
Fueling a controversy that has been simmering for years the Census Bureau also said its figures would look far rosier if it recalculated the poverty threshold using an improved consumer-price measure adopted in 1983
The bureau said some 3.5 million fewer people would have fallen below the poverty line in 1988 and the poverty rate would have been 10.5 % instead of 13.1 % under the alternative calculation
Critics on the left and right have been calling for all sorts of revisions to the measure for years
A report by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress released yesterday concluded It is misleading to make this change without adjusting for other changes
The official poverty threshold is set by the Office of Management and Budget
John E. Hayes Jr. was elected chairman president and chief executive officer succeeding David S. Black who retired
Mr. Hayes 52 years old left Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. in January where he had been chairman president and chief executive to join Triad Capital Partners a St. Louis company with interests in solid waste and recycling telecommunications and international venture capital
He has resigned his posts at Triad to take the Kansas Power positions
Kansas Power said Mr. Black 61 chose early retirement
The space shuttle Atlantis boosted the Galileo spacecraft on its way to Jupiter giving a big lift as well to an ambitious U.S. program of space exploration
Seven years late in the launching 1 billion over budget and a target of anti-nuclear protestors Galileo has long been a symbol of trouble for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
But yesterday as Atlantis rumbled into a patch of clear sky above Florida with storm clouds closing in on it NASA sought to turn Galileo into a symbol of triumph
NASA did it right that 's the message said J.R. Thompson the agency 's deputy administrator
The 1.4 billion robot spacecraft faces a six-year journey to explore Jupiter and its 16 known moons
If all goes well it will parachute a probe into the dense Jovian atmosphere in July 1995 to pick up detailed data about gases that may be similar to the material from which the solar system was formed 4.6 billion years ago
Jupiter is so enormous its mass is 318 times that of Earth that its gravity may have trapped these primordial gases and never let them escape
Investigating Jupiter in detail may provide clues to what astronomer Tobias Owen calls the cosmic paradox of life Jupiter and other bodies in the outer solar system are rich in elements such as hydrogen that are essential for life on Earth but these planets are lifeless Earth on the other hand has a diminished store of such material but is rich in life
Some scientists have suggested that comets and asteroids may have brought enough of this kind of material from the outer solar system to Earth to spawn life
Beginning in December 1995 Galileo will begin a two-year tour of the Jovian moons
In 1979 two Voyager spacecraft sent back stunning photos of Jovian moons Io and Europa that showed them to be among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system
The photos showed active geysers on Io spewing sulfurous material 190 miles into its atmosphere and indicated that Europa may have an ocean hidden under a thick sheet of ice
Galileo 's photos of Europa will be more than 1,000 times as sharp as Voyager 's according to Torrence Johnson Galileo 's project scientist and may show whether it actually has the only known ocean other than those on Earth
Atlantis lifted Galileo from the launch pad at 12:54 p.m. EDT and released the craft from its cargo bay about six hours later
Galileo is on its way to another world in the hands of the best flight controllers in this world Atlantis Commander Donald Williams said
Fly safely
The five-member Atlantis crew will conduct several experiments including growing plants and processing polymeric materials in space before their scheduled landing at Edwards Air Force Base Calif. Monday
The Galileo project started in 1977 and a number of project veterans were on hand to watch the launch
An ebullient Mr. Johnson wearing a NASA baseball cap and carrying a camera and binoculars called the launch fantastic
Benny Chin manager of the Galileo probe compared it to watching a child leave home
I 'm happy and sad he said
Anti-nuclear activists took a less positive view
Having argued that Galileo 's plutonium power source could have released lethal doses of radiation if the shuttle exploded yesterday they were n't quieted by yesterday 's successful launch
Galileo will skim past Earth in 1990 and 1992 collecting energy from the planet 's gravitational field to gain momentum for its trip to Jupiter
The protesters point out that Galileo also could crash to Earth then
They said they dropped plans to infiltrate the Kennedy Space Center after NASA beefed up its security
One protest did get past NASA 's guard though a computer virus caused anti-Galileo messages to flash onto some computer screens at NASA centers
The successful launch continues a remarkable recovery in the U.S. space-science program
An unmanned spacecraft Magellan already is heading to Venus and is due to begin mapping the planet next August
Voyager 2 sent back spectacular photos of Neptune and its moon Triton this summer
Next month NASA plans to launch a satellite to study cosmic rays dating from the birth of the universe
In December the shuttle Columbia will try to retrieve a satellite that 's been in orbit for nearly five years measuring the deleterious effects of space on materials and instruments
Next March the shuttle Discovery will launch the Hubble space telescope a 1.5 billion instrument designed to see the faintest galaxies in the universe
Not all of NASA 's space-science work will be so auspicious though
Around Thanksgiving the Solar Max satellite which NASA repaired in orbit in 1984 will tumble back into the Earth 's atmosphere
NASA wo n't attempt a rescue instead it will try to predict whether any of the rubble will smash to the ground and where
The Associated Press 's earthquake coverage drew attention to a phenomenon that deserves some thought by public officials and other policy makers
Private relief agencies such as the Salvation Army and Red Cross mobilized almost instantly to help people while the Washington bureaucracy took hours getting into gear
One news show we saw yesterday even displayed 25 federal officials meeting around a table
We recall that the mayor of Charleston complained bitterly about the federal bureaucracy 's response to Hurricane Hugo
The sense grows that modern public bureaucracies simply do n't perform their assigned functions well
Bally Manufacturing Corp. and New York developer Donald Trump have agreed in principle to a 6.5 million settlement of shareholder litigation stemming from Bally 's alleged greenmail payment to Mr. Trump
According to lawyers familiar with the settlement talks the verbal agreement to end a lawsuit filed more than two years ago was reached last week and will soon be submitted to a federal judge in Camden N.J
In February 1987 Bally thwarted a possible hostile takeover bid from Mr. Trump by agreeing to buy 2.6 million of Mr. Trump 's 3.1 million Bally shares for 83.7 million more than 18 million above market price
The term greenmail refers to a situation where a company pays a premium over market value to repurchase a stake held by a potential acquirer
Lawyers for shareholders Bally and Mr. Trump all declined to talk publicly about the proposed settlement citing a request by a federal court magistrate not to reveal details of the agreement until it is completed
But some attorneys who are familiar with the matter said the 6.5 million payment will be shared by Bally and Mr. Trump with the casino and hotel concern probably paying the bulk of the money
The amount Bally and Mr. Trump will pay to settle the class-action suit pales in comparison to the 45 million Walt Disney Co. and Saul Steinberg 's Reliance Group Holdings Inc. agreed to pay to settle a similar suit in July
That settlement represented the first time shareholders were granted a major payment in a greenmail case
Mr. Steinberg made a 59.7 million profit on the sale to Disney of his investment in the company in 1984
But lawyers said Mr. Steinberg probably faced much more potential liability because when he sued Disney during his takeover battle he filed on behalf of all shareholders
When Disney offered to pay Mr. Steinberg a premium for his shares the New York investor did n't demand the company also pay a premium to other shareholders
When Mr. Trump sued Bally he sued only on behalf of himself
Mr. Trump and Bally also appeared to have some leverage in the case because in the state of Delaware where Bally is incorporated courts have held that greenmail is often protected by the business-judgment rule
That rule gives boards of directors wide latitude in deciding how to deal with dissident shareholders
SENATE HEARS final arguments in impeachment trial of federal judge
Yesterday U.S. Judge Alcee Hastings faced his jury the full U.S. Senate and said I am not guilty of having committed any crime
Seventeen articles of impeachment against the Florida judge one of the few blacks on the U.S. bench were approved by the House in August 1988
The central charge against Judge Hastings is that he conspired with a Washington lawyer to obtain a 150,000 bribe from defendants in a criminal case before the judge in return for leniency
He is also accused of lying under oath and of leaking information obtained from a wiretap he supervised
The Senate 's public gallery was packed with Judge Hastings ' supporters who erupted into applause after he finished his argument
Judge Hastings who was acquitted of similar charges by a federal jury in 1983 claims he is being victimized and that the impeachment proceedings against him constitute double jeopardy
But Rep. John Bryant D. Texas the lead counsel for the House managers who conducted a lengthy inquiry into Judge Hastings ' activities said a mountain of evidence points to his certain guilt
The Senate will deliberate behind closed doors today and is scheduled to vote on the impeachment tomorrow
If the judge is impeached as is thought likely he will be removed from office immediately
However Judge Hastings has said he will continue to fight and is contemplating an appeal of any impeachment to the U.S. Supreme Court
COMPANIES SEEKING to make insurers pay for pollution cleanup win court victory
In a case involving Avondale Industries Inc. and its insurer Travelers Cos. the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled in favor of the company on two issues that lawyers say are central to dozens of pollution cases around the country
Travelers and other insurers have maintained that cleanup costs are n't damages and thus are n't covered under commercial policies
They also have argued that government proceedings notifying a company of potential responsibility do n't fit the legal definition of a lawsuit thus such governmental proceedings are n't covered by the policies the insurers say
The appeals court disagreed on both counts
Avondale was notified by Louisiana officials in 1986 that it was potentially responsible for a cleanup at an oil-recycling plant
Avondale asked Travelers to defend it in the state proceeding but the insurer did n't respond
The appeals court upheld a district judge 's ruling that the insurer had to defend the company in such proceedings
The appeals court also said We think an ordinary businessman reading this policy would have believed himself covered for the demands and potential damage claims stemming from any cleanup
This decision will have a very considerable impact said Kenneth Abraham professor of environmental law and insurance law at the University of Virginia because many commercial insurance policies are issued by companies based in New York
William Greaney an attorney for the Chemical Manufacturers Association said that while other appeals courts have ruled differently on whether cleanup costs are damages the influence of the appeals court in New York will make insurers sit up and listen
He said the decision was the first in which a federal appeals court has ruled whether administrative government proceedings qualify as litigation
Barry R. Ostrager an attorney for Travelers said there are procedural bases on which this case will be appealed further
NEW YORK 'S poor face nearly three million legal problems a year without legal help
That is the conclusion of a report released by the New York State Bar Association
The report was based on a telephone survey of 1,250 low-income households across the state a mail survey of major legal-services programs and on-site interviews with individuals in the field
The report provides detailed documentation of the extent and nature of the problem and indicates how we may want to shape solutions said Joseph Genova chairman of the committee that oversaw the survey and a partner at the law firm of Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy
According to the study slightly more than 34 % of those surveyed reported having at least one housing problem every year for which they had no legal help
Nearly 36 % ranked housing problems as their most serious unmet legal need
Other areas targeted by the survey 's respondents included difficulty obtaining or maintaining public benefits 22 % consumer fraud 15.4 % and health-care issues 15 %
During the 15-month survey 43 % of all legal-services programs said that at some period they were unable to accept new clients unless they had an emergency
Mr. Genova said the committee may meet to propose solutions to the problems identified in the study
PROSECUTOR TO JOIN Gibson Dunn Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Mastro who headed the government 's racketeering case against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters will join Gibson Dunn & Crutcher in its New York office
Mr. Mastro has been with the New York U.S. attorney 's office for nearly five years
In 1987 he became deputy chief of the civil division
Mr. Mastro will do civil litigation and white-collar defense work for Gibson Dunn which is based in Los Angeles
FORMER APPLE COMPUTER Inc. general counsel John P. Karalis has joined the Phoenix Ariz. law firm of Brown & Bain
Mr. Karalis 51 will specialize in corporate law and international law at the 110-lawyer firm
Before joining Apple in 1986 Mr. Karalis served as general counsel at Sperry Corp
After failing to find a buyer for the Sears Tower in Chicago Sears Roebuck & Co. is negotiating with Boston pension fund adviser Aldrich Eastman & Waltch Inc. to refinance the property for close to 850 million according to people close to the negotiations
Under the proposed agreement involving the world 's tallest building Chicago-based Sears would receive about half the money through conventional mortgage financing and the other half as a convertible mortgage
At the end of the term of the convertible loan Sears could still own half the building and AEW could own the other half
Neither side would comment
The parties are currently negotiating over who would manage the building which will be emptied of 6,000 employees from Sears ' merchandise group which is moving elsewhere
The new manager will face the daunting task of leasing 1.8 million square feet in a relatively soft Chicago real estate market
Also it has not yet been decided exactly how much of the mortgage AEW will be able to convert into equity
Convertible mortgages have become an increasingly popular way to finance prestigious buildings of late
In a convertible mortgage the investor lends the building owner a certain amount in return for the option to convert its interest into equity usually less than 50 % at the end of the loan term
During the term the lender can either receive a percentage of cash flow a percentage of the building 's appreciation or a fixed return
The main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and reappraisal
Sears said it would put the 110-story tower on the block almost a year ago as part of its anti-takeover restructuring
But Japanese institutions shied away from bidding on the high-profile tower out of fear their purchase of the property would trigger anti-Japanese sentiment
Last summer Sears appeared to have a deal with Canadian developer Olympia & York Developments Ltd
But that deal fell through in September after it became clear that the sale would lead to a major real estate tax reassessment raising property taxes and making it difficult to lease the building at competitive prices
Real estate industry executives said Sears ' investment banker Goldman Sachs & Co. sought financing in Japan
However Japanese authorities apparently were concerned that a refinancing also would attract too much publicity
Sears then went back to AEW the Boston pension adviser that had proposed a convertible debt deal during the first round of bids last spring
AEW has 3.5 billion of real estate investments nationwide according to a spokesman
Tandy Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire two units of Datatronic AB of Stockholm for cash
The amount was n't disclosed
The electronics maker and retailer previously estimated the sale price at between 100 million and 200 million for Datatronic 's Victor microcomputer and Micronic hand-held computer subsidiaries
In addition Tandy will acquire rights to the Victor and Micronic names for computers
During 1988 the Datatronic subsidiaries had combined sales in excess of 200 million
The transaction will give Tandy a well-known European computer brand that includes 2,700 dealers and distributors marketing to medium-sized business and educational institutions
Closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions and regulatory approvals the company said
Two rules in pending congressional legislation threaten to hinder leveraged buy-outs by raising the price tags of such deals by as much as 10 %
Wall Street is seething over the rules which would curtail the tax deductibility of debt used in most LBOs
The provisions in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the House and Senate could further cool the takeover boom that has been the driving force behind the bull market in stocks for much of the 1980s some tax experts and investment bankers argue
Indeed some investment bankers have already started restructuring deals to cope with the expected rules
Wall Street has all but conceded on the issue and is now lobbying for the less onerous Senate version of one of the provisions
At issue is the deductibility of certain junk bonds that are used in most LBOs
Such high-yield debt is similar to a zero-coupon bond in that it is sold at a discount to face value with interest accruing instead of being paid to the holder
Under current rules that accrued interest is deductible by the company issuing the debt
The House version of the legislation would kill that deduction and label any such debt as equity which is n't deductible
The less-rigorous Senate version would defer the deductibility for roughly five years
You see these in just about every LBO said Robert Willens senior vice president in charge of tax issues at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York
It becomes a source of cash for the company making the LBO because it gets a deduction and does n't have to repay the debt for several years
Typically Mr. Willens estimates this type of debt makes up 15 % to 20 % of the financing for LBOs
These types of bonds have been used in buy-outs of companies such as RJR Nabisco Inc. Storer Communications Inc. and Kroger Co
A second provision passed by the Senate and House would eliminate a rule allowing companies that post losses resulting from LBO debt to receive refunds of taxes paid over the previous three years
For example if a company posted a loss of 100 million from buy-out interest payments the existing rule would allow the concern to be able to receive a refund from the tax it paid from 1986 through 1989 when it may have been a profitable public company
But that rule is being virtually overlooked by Wall Street which is concentrating on coping with the deduction issue
Prices for LBOs have to come down if you do n't have that feature argued Lawrence Schloss managing director for merchant banking at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York
Several Wall Street officials say the proposed legislation already is having an impact
An investment group led by Chicago 's Pritzker family recently lowered a 3.35 billion bid for American Medical International Beverly Hills Calif. because of the threat of the legislation
Moreover one investment banker who requested anonymity said his firm did n't raise the ante for a target company earlier this month after a stronger bid emerged from a public company that was n't concerned about the financing provision
We would have paid more if we thought that law was n't going to pass he said
One possible solution for Wall Street is to increase the equity part of the transaction that is give lenders a bigger stake in the surviving company rather than just interest payments
That would force the buy-out firm and the target company 's management to reduce their level of ownership
The pigs in the trough may have to give a little bit of the slop back and then the deal can go through said Peter C. Canellos tax partner at Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz
Another solution said a tax lawyer who requested anonymity is for firms to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount
Since they have a lower interest rate they would n't fall under the junk-bond category that would lose its deductibility
The House version of the bill would make debt non-deductible if it pays five percentage points above Treasury notes has at least a five-year maturity and does n't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five
The bill would then declare that the debt is equity and therefore is n't deductible
The Senate bill would only deny the deduction until interest is actually paid
Currently even though the issuer does n't pay tax the debt holder is taxed on the accrued interest
But those holders are often foreign investors and tax-exempt pension funds that do n't pay taxes on their holdings
The Senate estimates that its version of the provision would yield 17 million the first year and a total of 409 million over five years
The House version would raise slightly more
Even if Wall Street finds ways around the new rules a Senate aide contends LBOs will become somewhat more difficult
There 's no question it will make LBOs more expensive he said
The interest deduction was the engine that made these things more productive
The average publicly offered commodity fund fell 4.2 % in September largely because of the volatile markets in foreign currencies according to Norwood Securities
The firm said that losers outnumbered gainers by more than three to one among the 122 funds it tracks
For the first nine months of the year Norwood said the average fund has lost 3.3 %
The government moved aggressively to open the spigots of federal aid for victims of the California earthquake but its reservoir of emergency funds must be replenished soon if the aid is to continue
President Bush signed a disaster declaration covering seven Northern California counties
The declaration immediately made the counties eligible for temporary housing grants and low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses
In addition an unusually wide array of federal agencies moved to provide specialized assistance
The Department of Housing and Urban Development prepared to make as many as 100 vacant houses available for those left homeless the Agriculture Department was set to divert food from the school-lunch program to earthquake victims and the Pentagon was providing everything from radio communications to blood transfusions to military police for directing traffic
But the pool of federal emergency-relief funds already is running low because of the heavy costs of cleaning up Hurricane Hugo and Congress will be under pressure to allocate more money quickly
In Hugo 's wake Congress allocated 1.1 billion in relief funds and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said 273 million of that money remains and could be diverted for quick expenditures related to the earthquake
Now though enormous costs for earthquake relief will pile on top of outstanding costs for hurricane relief
That obviously means that we wo n't have enough for all of the emergencies that are now facing us and we will have to consider appropriate requests for follow-on funding Mr. Fitzwater said
The federal government is n't even attempting yet to estimate how much the earthquake will cost it
But Mr. Fitzwater said There will be I think quite obviously a very large amount of money required from all levels of government
In Congress lawmakers already are looking for ways to add relief funds
Money could be added to a pending spending bill covering the Federal Emergency Management Agency which coordinates federal disaster relief
More likely relief funds could be added to an omnibus spending bill that Congress is to begin considering next week
But it is n't just Washington 's relief dollars that are spread thin its relief manpower also is stretched
FEMA still has special disaster centers open to handle the aftermath of Hugo and spokesman Russell Clanahan acknowledged that we 're pretty thin
Mr. Clanahan says FEMA now possibly may have the heaviest caseload in its history
To further complicate relief efforts the privately funded American Red Cross also finds itself strapped for funds after its big Hugo operation
It 's been a bad month money-wise and every other way said Sally Stewart a spokeswoman for the Red Cross
It just makes it a little rough when you have to worry about the budget
The Red Cross has opened 30 shelters in the Bay area serving 5,000 people
Twenty-five trucks capable of cooking food were dispatched from other states
All the precise types of federal aid that will be sent to California wo n't be determined until state officials make specific requests to FEMA agency officials said
And in the confusion after the earthquake the information flow is a little slow coming in from the affected area said Carl Suchocki a FEMA spokesman
Still some aid is moving westward from Washington almost immediately
HUD officials said they will make available as many as 100 Bay area houses that are under HUD loans but now are vacant after the houses have been inspected to ensure they are sound
Additional housing vouchers and certificates will be made available officials said and some housing and community-development funds may be shifted from other programs or made available for emergency use
Another federal agency not normally associated with disaster relief the Internal Revenue Service moved quickly as well
The IRS said it will waive certain tax penalties for earthquake victims unable to meet return deadlines or make payments because of the quake 's devastation
The agency plans to announce specific relief procedures in the coming days
And the Treasury said residents of the San Francisco area will be able to cash in savings bonds even if they have n't held them for the minimum six-month period
One advantage that federal officials have in handling earthquake relief is the large number of military facilities in the San Francisco Bay area facilities that provide a ready base of supplies and workers
Even before the full extent of the devastation was known Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the military services to set up an emergency command center in the Pentagon and prepare to respond to various FEMA requests for assistance
By yesterday afternoon Air Force transport planes began moving additional rescue and medical supplies physicians communications equipment and FEMA personnel to California
A military jet flew a congressional delegation and senior Bush administration officials to survey the damage
And the Pentagon said dozens of additional crews and transport aircraft were on alert awaiting orders to move emergency supplies
Two Air Force facilities near Sacramento and Travis Air Force Base 50 miles northeast of San Francisco were designated to serve as medical-airlift centers
Some victims also were treated at the Letterman Army Medical Center in San Francisco and at the Naval Hospital in Oakland
In addition 20 military police from the Presidio a military base in San Francisco are assisting with traffic control and a Navy ship was moved from a naval station at Treasure Island near the Bay Bridge to San Francisco to help fight fires
To help residents in Northern California rebuild FEMA intends to set up 17 disaster assistance offices in the earthquake area in the next several days and to staff them with 400 to 500 workers from various agencies said Robert Volland chief of the agency 's individual assistance division
At these offices earthquake victims will be helped in filling out a one-page form that they will need to qualify for such federal assistance as home-improvement loans and to repair houses
And federal officials are promising to move rapidly with federal highway aid to rebuild the area 's severely damaged road system
The Federal Highway Administration has an emergency relief program to help states and local governments repair federally funded highways and bridges seriously damaged by natural disasters
The account currently has 220 million
And though federal law dictates that only 100 million can be disbursed from that fund in any one state per disaster administration officials expect Congress to move in to authorize spending more now in California
To get that money states must go through an elaborate approval process but officials expect red tape to be cut this time
Keith Mulrooney special assistant to Federal Highway Administrator Thomas Larson also said that after the 1971 San Fernando earthquake in Southern California the state set tougher standards for bridges and with federal aid began a program to retrofit highways and bridges for earthquake hazards
The first phase of the program has been completed but two other phases are continuing
The two major structures that failed Tuesday night he said were both built well before the 1971 earthquake the San Francisco Bay Bridge completed in the 1930s and the section of I-880 built in the 1950s
The I-880 section had completed the first phase of the retrofitting

Northrop Corp. 's third-quarter net income fell 25 % to 21.5 million or 46 cents a share while General Dynamics Corp. reported nearly flat earnings of 76.5 million or 1.83 a share
Los Angeles-based Northrop recorded an 8.2 % decline in sales as B-2 Stealth bomber research-and-development revenue continued to ebb and high costs on some other programs cut into profit
The aerospace concern earned 28.8 million or 61 cents a share a year earlier
Sales in the latest period were 1.25 billion down from 1.36 billion in the 1988 quarter
At St. Louis-based General Dynamics sales rose 10 % to 2.52 billion from 2.29 billion
It earned 76.4 million or 1.82 a share in the 1988 quarter
General Dynamics credited significant earnings gains in its general aviation and material service segments an earnings recovery in submarine operations and higher military aircraft sales
Northrop said sales fell because of the decline in B-2 development dollars from the government as the plane continues its initial production stage and because fewer F\/A-18 fighter sections are being produced in its subcontract work with prime contractor McDonnell Douglas Corp
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Northrop shares closed at 21.125 off 25 cents
General Dynamics closed at 54.875 up 50 cents
Northrop which since early 1988 has declined to accept fixed-price contracts for research and development said earnings were hurt by excessive costs on a number of such contracts won years ago
Among them were the ALQ-135 electronic countermeasures system for the F-15 fighter
Northrop 's interest expense also soared to 35 million from 17 million a year ago
It said debt remained at the 1.22 billion that has prevailed since early 1989 although that compared with 911 million at Sept. 30 1988
The backlog of undelivered orders at Northrop on Sept. 30 was 4.68 billion down from 5.16 billion a year earlier
For the nine months Northrop reported a net loss of 46.9 million or 1 a share compared with profit of 190.3 million or 4.05 a share in 1988
Sales dipped 3.6 % to 3.92 billion from 4.07 billion
At General Dynamics factors reducing earnings in the military aircraft segment included higher levels of cost-sharing in development of the Advanced Tactical Fighter and the high cost of an advanced version of the F-16 fighter
F-16 deliveries also have fallen slightly behind schedule although a return to the previous schedule is expected in 1990 the company said
Backlog at General Dynamics rose to 16.5 billion from 15.8 billion
Its interest expense surged to 21.5 million from 12.4 million
For the nine months General Dynamics earned 210.3 million or 5.03 a share up marginally from 208.8 million or 4.97 a share on a 4.9 % rise in sales to 7.41 billion from 7.06 billion
Lotus Development Corp. reported a surprisingly strong 51 % increase in third-quarter net income on a 32 % sales gain buoyed by strong demand for a new version of its 1-2-3 computer spreadsheet
The results topped analysts ' expectations and the earnings growth of competitors prompting traders to all but forget the product-launch delays that bogged down the company for much of the past two years
Yesterday in heavy national over-the-counter trading Lotus shares rose to 32.50 up 1.25 apiece capping a threemonth run-up of more than 40 %
Lotus said net rose to 23 million or 54 cents a share on sales of 153.9 million
A year ago net was 14.3 million or 31 cents a share on sales of 116.8 million
For the nine months net of 38.5 million or 92 cents a share trailed the year earlier 's 49.9 million or 1.08 a share
Sales rose to 406 million from 356 million the year earlier
In the first half Lotus struggled to keep market share with costly promotions while customers awaited the launch of 1-2-3 Release 3 the upgraded spreadsheet software
Lotus 's results were about 10 % higher than analysts ' average expectations and compared favorably with the 36 % earnings rise reported a day earlier by rival Microsoft Corp. of Redmond Wash
The company said results were bolstered by upgrades to Release 3 by previous customers and improved profit margins the result of manufacturing-cost controls
Rick Sherlund a Goldman Sachs analyst said Lotus had upgrade revenue of about 22 million in the quarter twice what he had expected
Also he estimated unit shipments of 1-2-3 in all its forms were about 315,000 up 7 % from 1988 's quarterly average
Demand for the new version was enabling Lotus to raise prices with distributors and to hold market share against Microsoft and other competitors that tried to exploit the earlier delays in Release 3 's launch Mr. Sherlund added
He estimated that 1-2-3 outsold Microsoft 's Excel spreadsheet by four-to-one in the quarter and held a 70 % or better share of the spreadsheet market
Silicon Valley heaved a sigh of relief yesterday
Though details were sketchy in the aftermath of the violent earthquake that shook the high-tech corridor along with the rest of the San Francisco Bay area a spot check of computer makers turned up little if any potentially lingering damage to facilities or fabrication equipment
Analysts and corporate officials said they expected practically no long-term disruption in shipments from the Valley of either hardware or software goods
Intel Corp. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National Semiconductor Corp. were all up and running yesterday though many workers were forced to stay home because of damaged roadways others elected to take the day off
These systems are more rugged than many people would believe said Thomas Kurlak who tracks the computer industry for Merrill Lynch Research
It 's not the end of the world if you shake them up a little bit
Other companies including International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. completely idled their operations because of Tuesday evening 's temblor which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale
Personnel spent the morning inspecting buildings for structural weaknesses mopping up water from broken pipes and clearing ceiling tiles and other debris from factory floors
Still many were confident that in a day or two everything should be back to normal according to a spokeswoman for the Semiconductor Industry Association based in Cupertino
IBM for instance said it anticipates returning to a normal work schedule by the weekend at its San Jose plant which puts out disk drives for the 3090 family of mainframes
A Hewlett-Packard spokeswoman said that while things are a big mess some 18,000 Valley employees have been called back to work today
Apple Computer added that it was being cautiously optimistic despite not yet closely eyeballing all of its 50 buildings in the region
Even the carefully calibrated machinery in its giant Fremont plant to the north of the Valley was believed to be undamaged
Sun Microsystems Inc. and Tandem Computers Inc. also signaled that they should recover quickly
Digital Equipment Corp. with major facilities in Santa Clara Cupertino Palo Alto and Mountain View said that all of its engineering and manufacturing sites had reported to corporate headquarters in Maynard Mass. Tuesday night
None sustained significant damage a spokesman said adding that the delicate manufacturing process machines were checked and were all found to be operating normally
For many companies of course there is still a slew of nagging problems to grapple with some of which have the potential to become quite serious
For example a spokesman for Advanced Micro Devices said the Sunnyvale chip maker is worried about blackouts
A sudden surge or drop in electric power could ruin integrated circuits being built
But given what might have happened to the fragile parts that are at the heart of the microelectronics business the bulk of Valley companies seemed to be just about shouting hosannas
Several factors apparently spared the Valley a sprawling suburban stretch from San Jose to Palo Alto from the kind of impact felt in San Francisco an hour 's drive north
For one thing buildings there tend to be newer and thus in step with the latest safety codes
Also the soil in the Valley is solid unlike the landfill of San Francisco 's downtown Marina District which was hit with fires and vast destruction
In addition some microelectronics companies said they were prepared for tremulous conditions like Tuesday 's
Their machine tools are even bolted to the shop floor
Intel said that over the past decade it has installed computer sensors and shutoff valves sensitive to the shake of an earthquake in the pipes that snake through its plants
Like other large Valley companies Intel also noted that it has factories in several parts of the nation so that a breakdown at one location should n't leave customers in a total pinch
That 's certainly good news for such companies as Compaq Computer Corp. Houston which has only a four-day supply of microprocessors from the Valley on hand because of a just-in-time manufacturing approach that limits the buildup of inventory
Compaq said it foresees no difficulties in obtaining parts in the immediate future
Computer makers were scrambling to help customers recover from the disaster
Digital Equipment has set up disaster-recovery response centers in Dallas Atlanta and Colorado Springs Colo
These units were handling calls both from people in the San Francisco area and from computers themselves which are set to dial Digital automatically when trouble arises
They then run remotely controlled self-diagnostic programs
Digital also said it has dispatched teams of technicians to California
Meanwhile several other major installations around the Valley America 's center of high-tech said they too fared as well as could be expected
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory where the Energy Department tests and conducts research on nuclear weapons had only superficial damage a spokesman said
At Lockheed Corp. 's missiles and space systems group in Sunnyvale about 40 miles south of San Francisco workers were asked to head to work yesterday after it was realized that there were no show-stoppers in the 150-plus buildings on its one-square-mile campus
Several engineering and research offices needed closer scrutiny to make sure they were n't in danger of crumbling but the bulk of the place is in pretty good shape an official said
One of Lockheed 's most lucrative sectors accounting for more than half the aerospace company 's 10.59 billion in sales in 1988 the missiles and space group is the prime Pentagon contractor on the Trident II ballistic missile
It also generates pieces of the missile shield called the Strategic Defense Initiative
Fortunately the Hubble Space Telescope set to be launched on the shuttle next year in a search for distant solar systems and light emitted 14 billion years ago from the farthest reaches of the universe was moved from Sunnyvale to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at the beginning of October

Michael Maynard offered the world a faster way to break eggs
As thanks the egg industry tried to break him
And the egg producers have done a pretty good job
They tried to put Mr. Maynard out of business by an act of Congress
Egg-industry lobbying helped persuade six states to ban Mr. Maynard 's automatic egg-breaking machine because of fears over salmonella
His company Misa Manufacturing Inc. was forced to seek protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law in 1987 and has since been liquidated
Monthly sales of his Egg King machine which he now is marketing through a new company have sunk to about half a dozen from a peak of 75 says the 46-year-old businessman
Mr. Maynard is n't the first entrepreneur to bump up against entrenched interests
But his case is notable both for the scale of the fight it is n't often that a congressional hearing is held to determine whether one small businessman is a threat to the republic and for what it tells about the pitfalls of marketing a new product
Now one might ask why people who sell eggs would fight someone who is trying to make it easier to crack them
Part of the answer lies in the nature of the industry
Many larger egg producers are also egg processors who crack inspect and sanitize billions of eggs turning them into powdered liquified or frozen egg products
However dozens of bakers restaurant chefs and other food preparers who flocked to Mr. Maynard 's defense say that products ranging from egg bread to eclairs lose some zip when the eggs come in 30-pound cans instead of shells
But for companies that use hundreds of eggs a day breaking them by hand can get well out of hand
The idea behind the Egg King is pretty simple put the eggs into a cylinder that contains perforated baskets spin them at a high speed to break the shells and strain the edible part through the baskets
One Egg King which at just under four feet tall and two feet wide has been likened to the robot R2-D2 can crack about 20,000 eggs an hour
Because fresh eggs are less expensive than processed ones a big egg user can recover the Egg King 's 3,390 cost in a few months says Mr. Maynard
Such centrifugal egg breakers have been around since the 1890s
But when Mr. Maynard came forward with his machine in the early 1970s nobody else was offering them in the U.S.
The main reason salmonella
Chickens carry this bacteria which can cause upset stomachs and in rare cases death among people
Hens sometimes pass salmonella to the eggs and it can also be found on unclean shells
Thus any machine that breaks large amounts of eggs at once has the potential to spread salmonella if a bad egg gets in with the good ones
Mr. Maynard claims this is a manageable problem
The Egg King carries written instructions to break only high-grade eggs that have been properly sanitized and as an added precaution to use the eggs only in products that will be cooked enough to kill bacteria
With nearly 4,000 machines in use there have been no salmonella problems as long as instructions were followed Mr. Maynard boasts
He says the handful of salmonella cases involving products that may have used eggs broken by an Egg King stemmed from a failure to adequately cook the products
But he says that 's no more a reason for banning Egg Kings than bad drivers are a reason for banning cars
Opponents do n't buy such arguments
Human nature being what it is people do n't always follow instructions says Jack Guzewich chief of food protection for the New York state Health Department
Leading the assault against the Egg King has been United Egg Producers
The Decatur Ga. trade group has issued a briefing book that claims the machine is a health hazard and that Mr. Maynard is trying to make a fast buck at the expense of the nation 's egg producers
The UEP declines to comment but the group 's attorney Alfred Frawley says the group 's actions are motivated solely by health concerns
An early battleground was the U.S. Department of Agriculture
Mr. Maynard initially won approval for his machine to be used at egg-processing facilities regulated by the USDA 's Food Safety Inspection Service
Unfortunately for Mr. Maynard another branch of the USDA the Agricultural Marketing Service was in charge of eggs
After receiving complaints from egg producers this branch got the other branch to rescind its approval thus limiting the machine 's potential market to bakeries and restaurants and other establishments that are n't regulated by the USDA
The egg producers also lobbied the Food and Drug Administration
But the FDA in a 1985 letter to the United Egg Producers said that there was little likelihood of a health problem as long as instructions were followed
So the producers went to Capitol Hill where a congressman from Georgia introduced a measure to ban centrifugal egg-breaking machines
Mr. Maynard whose company at the time was based in Santa Ana Calif. enlisted his local congressman and the battle was joined
Mr. Maynard 's forces finally defeated the measure though it took a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives to do it
Even then opponents managed to get a congressional hearing to examine what one congressman called an unscrupulous method for breaking eggs
Foiled in their effort to get a national ban the egg producers turned their attention to the states
So far New York New Jersey Nebraska Georgia Michigan and Minnesota have outlawed Mr. Maynard 's device citing health concerns
An antitrust suit that Mr. Maynard 's company filed in Los Angeles federal court against the United Egg Producers and others only added to the entrepreneur 's woes
The judge dismissed the suit and ordered Mr. Maynard 's company to pay over 100,000 in legal fees to the defendants ' lawyers
Mr. Maynard says the ruling pushed his company into bankruptcy court
Now he has moved to Oklahoma where costs are lower and started a new company Adsi Inc. to market his machine
But so far the change of scenery has n't ended his string of bad breaks
Mr. Maynard recently fell from a horse and fractured his arm
Michelle Pfeiffer ca n't chew gum and sing at the same time
But on the evidence of The Fabulous Baker Boys that may be the only thing she ca n't do at least when she 's acting in movies
As the tough slinky lounge chanteuse in The Fabulous Baker Boys Ms. Pfeiffer sings for herself and more than passably well
Her Susie Diamond handles a song the way the greats do like she 's hearing the way it should sound inside her head and she 's concentrating on matching that internal tone
Yet her intensity stops and starts with the music
When she is n't performing for an audience she prepares for a song by removing the wad of gum from her mouth and indicates that she 's finished by sticking the gum back in
Like almost everything in this wonderfully romantic and edgy movie Ms. Pfeiffer 's Susie seems like someone you 've seen before in numerous show-biz stories even her name Susie Diamond sounds like a character Marilyn Monroe must have played
Yet nothing about Baker Boys and certainly nothing about Ms. Pfeiffer really is like something from the video vault
Steve Kloves the young writer and director he is n't yet 30 has only one produced picture to his credit he wrote the screenplay for Racing With the Moon a lovely coming-of-age picture set in the '40s
Both movies are infused with the nostalgic sensibility of someone much older someone who does n't dismiss dreams but who also has enough experience to see his limits
However Mr. Kloves directs his own material without sentimentality and at its own eccentric pace Baker Boys is both bluesy and funny
He 's put a fresh spin on material that could come off terribly cliched for example the way Susie wows an audience the first time she sings with the Baker Boys
Of course it does n't hurt that Mr. Kloves has made up for his lack of experience behind the camera with technicians who know exactly what they 're doing
Much of the picture 's sensuality emerges from cinematographer Michael Ballhaus 's slyly seductive lens work
After working for years with Werner Rainer Fassbinder the late German director and more recently with Martin Scorsese After Hours The Color of Money The Last Temptation of Christ Mr. Ballhaus has developed a distinctively fluid style
And Dave Grusin 's witty score embraces the banal requirements of banquet-hall musicianship Feelings is a must without condescension
Though Ms. Pfeiffer has the flashy part she gets the best comic bits and to wear glamorous dresses and spiked heels the boys are pretty great too
What seemed like a good idea to cast the Bridges brothers Jeff and Beau as the Baker brothers actually turned out to be a good idea
Anyone who 's tried to appear natural in front of a camera knows that it 's much more natural to end up looking like a stiff
So it 's quite possible that the terrific play between the brothers is n't natural at all that Jeff and Beau had to work like crazy to make their brotherly love and resentment and frustration and rage seem so very real
When the movie opens the Baker brothers are doing what they 've done for 15 years professionally and twice as long as that for themselves They 're playing proficient piano face-to-face on twin pianos
They 're small time in the small time-hotels not the best ones and restaurants in Seattle
Yet they do n't disparage their audiences by disparaging their act
They wear tuxedos most nights unless circumstances a regular gig at a tropical lounge for example require them to wear special costumes like Hawaiian shirts
Plump Beau looking eager to please with his arched eyebrows and round face plays the older brother Frank
Frank plans the program takes care of business and approaches the work like any other job
He 's even able to think of a job that takes him out of the house 300 nights a week as an ordinary job
He 's got a wife and two kids and a house in the suburbs the audience sees only the house and only near the end of the movie
Frank grovels a little for the bookers probably no more or less than he would have to if he worked for a big corporation
On his off-hours he wears cardigan sweaters
Jeff Bridges is the younger brother Jack who fancies himself the rebellious artist he lives in a loft with his sick dog and the occasional visit from the little girl upstairs who climbs down the fire escape
Yet Jack 's the one who can remember every dive they ever played and when and he dutifully shows up for work night after night he consoles himself with booze and by showing up at the last minute
Looking leaner than he has in a while the younger Mr. Bridges 's Jack is sexy and cynical and a far sadder case than Frank who 's managed to chisel his dreams to fit reality without feeling too cheated
He can live with little pleasures
Mr. Kloves has put together some priceless moments
These include Jennifer Tilly 's audition to be the Baker Boys ' girl singer
Ms. Tilly of the tweety-bird voice showed great comic promise during her stint as the mobster 's girlfriend on the television show Hill Street Blues
Here she delivers especially during her enthusiastically awful rendition of the Candy Man which she sings while prancing around in a little cotton candy pink angora sweater that could n't be more perfect
It matches her voice
And Ms. Pfeiffer 's particular version of Making Whoopee and the way Mr. Ballhaus photographs her from the tips of her red high heels right up her clingy red velvet dress might make you think of Marilyn Monroe if Ms. Pfeiffer had n't gone and become a star in her own right
VIDEO TIP If you 'd like to see the first time Michelle Pfeiffer sang on screen and you have a lot of patience take a look at Grease 2
You 'll find her there

Rep. Mary Rose Oakar D. Ohio at last week 's hearings on irregularities in programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development I do n't want to feel guilty representing my constituents
And if I think that some people on HUD Secretary Jack Kemp 's staff are off base in terms in which they 're evaluating certain things affecting my hometown I have to tell you something I 'm not going to take it
I think that I 'm elected to represent the people that sent me here
And one of our charges is to be an ombudsman for our area
And if we 're not ombudsman for our area we ought to be thrown out of office
On the other hand if we 're asking for something unreasonable or unethical and so on then that 's a whole different story
But if I feel that there are situations where I 'm trying to get housing for our area whatever it happens to be and I have to feel that I ca n't even ask a question I 've got to tell you I think that 's outrageous

I think these regulations that would prohibit well-operated programs in areas across this country would be wrong to change
I do n't want to see some guidelines change that 's going to inhibit my city 's opportunity to use its money
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it fined Capcom Futures Inc. 500,000 and accepted its withdrawal from membership as part of a settlement of disciplinary actions against the firm
Capcom Futures is a Chicago subsidiary of Capcom Financial Services Ltd. a London financial firm that was implicated last year in a scheme to launder drug money
The case is pending
The firm was indicted in Tampa Fla. on money-laundering charges
In June the Chicago Board of Trade said it suspended Capcom Financial
The Capcom Futures unit withdrew from Board of Trade membership voluntarily in August a Board of Trade spokesman said
Capcom Futures while neither admitting nor denying the Merc charges said in a statement that the Merc charges were technical in nature and that no customers were hurt as a result of the violations cited by the Merc
The Merc alleged that among other things from April 1987 through October 1988 Capcom Futures failed to document trades between Capcom Futures and people or entities directly or indirectly controlled by Capcom Futures shareholders

Money-market mutual fund assets grew at nearly three times their usual rate in the latest week as investors opted for safety instead of the stock market
Money-fund assets soared 4.5 billion in the week ended Tuesday to a record 348.4 billion according to IBC\/Donoghue 's Money Fund Report a Holliston Mass.-based newsletter
We were expecting it following the fall of the Dow Friday said Brenda Malizia Negus editor of Money Fund Report
It 's the proverbial flight to safety
Despite recent declines in interest rates money funds continue to offer better yields than other comparable investments
The average seven-day compound yield on the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC\/Donoghue 's was 8.55 % in the latest week down from 8.60 %
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that current yields continue for a year
Most short-term certificates of deposit are yielding about 8 % or less at major banks and the yields on Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction fell to 7.61 % for three months and 7.82 % for six months
Money-fund assets have been rising at an average rate of 1.6 billion a week in recent months Ms. Negus said reflecting the relatively high yields
In the latest week funds open to institutions alone grew by 1.8 billion
Some fund managers say inflows could increase in coming days as a result of stock selling in the wake of Friday 's 190.58 point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
If you 're selling equities you do n't start getting proceeds for five to seven days said Frank Rachwalski who manages the Kemper Money Market Fund
Neal Litvack marketing vice president for Fidelity Investments said inflows Friday into Fidelity 's Spartan and Cash Reserves money-market funds were about twice normal levels with about half coming from equity and junk-bond funds
Monday and Tuesday were lackluster in comparison he said
People are n't necessarily running scared Mr. Litvack said
They 're maintaining their attitude toward investing which has leaned toward the conservative recently
Money-fund yields tend to lag interestrate trends as portfolio managers adjust the maturities of their investments short-term Treasury securities commercial paper and the like to capture the highest yields
Maturities usually are shorter when rates are rising and longer when they are falling
The average maturity of the funds tracked by IBC\/Donoghue 's remained at 38 days for the third consecutive week
It was as short as 29 days at the start of this year when rates were marching steadily upward and hit 42 days in August
The average seven-day simple yield of the funds fell to 8.21 % this week from 8.26 %
The average 30-day simple yield was 8.26 % compared with 8.27 % the week before and the 30-day compound yield slid to 8.60 % from 8.61 %
Some funds are posting yields far higher than the average
The highest yielding taxable fund this week was Harbor Money Market Fund with a seven-day compound yield of 12.75 %
That included capital gains that were passed along to customers
Among the other high-yielding funds Fidelity 's Spartan Fund had a seven-day compound yield of 9.33 % in the latest week
The seven-day compound yield of the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Fund was 9.51 %
whose Della Femina McNamee WCRS agency created liar Joe Isuzu among others announced a massive restructuring that largely removes it from the advertising business and includes selling the majority of its advertising unit to Paris-based Eurocom
The complex restructuring which was long expected transforms London-based WCRS from primarily a creator of advertising into one of Europe 's largest buyers of advertising time and space
It also creates a newly merged world-wide ad agency controlled by Eurocom and headed jointly by New York ad man Jerry Della Femina and two top WCRS executives
The merged agency 's admittedly ambitious goal to become one of the world 's 10 largest agencies while attracting more multinational clients than the agencies were able to attract alone
WCRS 's restructuring reflects the growing importance of media buying in Europe where the only way to get a good price on advertising time and space is to buy it in bulk
For Eurocom meanwhile the move gives it a strong U.S. foothold in Della Femina and more than quadruples the size of its ad agency business world-wide
It also gives the outspoken Mr. Della Femina who often generates as much publicity for himself as for his clients an international platform that he most certainly wo n't be loath to use
According to terms WCRS will pay 2.02 billion French francs 318.6 million for the 50 % it does n't already own of Carat Holding S.A. one of Europe 's largest media buyers
Meanwhile Eurocom which had held 20 % of WCRS 's ad unit will pay 43.5 million 68.5 million to raise its stake to 60 %
That price also covers Eurocom raising to 60 % its 51 % stake in Europe 's Belier Group a joint venture ad agency network it owns with WCRS
Eurocom will also have the right to buy the remaining 40 % of the merged ad agency group in six years
The transaction places the three executives squarely at the helm of a major agency with the rather unwieldy name of Eurocom WCRS Della Femina Ball Ltd. or EWDB
The merged agency will include Della Femina McNamee based in New York Eurocom 's various agencies in France the Belier Group in Europe and WCRS 's other advertising and direct marketing operations
Mr. Della Femina will be joint chairman with former WCRS executive Robin Wight
Both will report to Tim Breene a former WCRS executive who will be chief executive officer at the new agency
In an interview in New York Mr. Breene fresh from a Concorde flight from Paris where executives had worked through most of the night outlined big plans for the new agency
Our goal is to develop quite rapidly to a top-10 position by the end of three years from now
It implies very dramatic growth he said
He added that Eurocom and WCRS had agreed to provide a development fund of 100 million for acquisitions
The new agency group is already in discussions about a possible purchase in Spain while Mr. Breene said it also plans to make acquisitions in Scandinavia Germany and elsewhere
Cracking the top 10 within three years will be difficult at best
Della Femina had billings of just 660 million last year and ranked as the U.S. 's 24th-largest ad agency
The merged company that it now becomes part of will have billings of just more than 2.6 billion most of that in Europe bringing it to about 14th world-wide
To make it to top-10 status it would have to leapfrog over such formidable forces as Grey Advertising D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles and Omnicom 's DDB Needham
The merged agency 's game plan to attract multinational packaged-goods advertisers may prove equally difficult
When WCRS created Della Femina McNamee out of the merger of three smaller agency units in 1988 it said it did so in order to attract larger clients especially packaged-goods companies
Since then Della Femina won Pan Am as an international client and also does work for a few packaged-goods clients including Dow Chemical Co. 's Saran Wrap
But major packaged-goods players of the world such as Procter & Gamble Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever have steadfastly eluded the agency
Three of our favorite names Mr. Della Femina calls that roster adding hopefully We 're a much more attractive agency to large multinationals today than we were yesterday
Still the restructuring could create one of the most powerful alliances between advertising and media-buying firms that Europe has seen
As part of the restructuring WCRS and Eurocom said they will look for ways to combine their media buying across Europe
What 's more both Eurocom and brothers Francis and Gilbert Gross who founded Carat will acquire 14.99 % stakes in WCRS Group creating a powerful link between Eurocom and Carat
Carat will receive its WCRS stake as part of payment for the 50 % Carat stake that WCRS is buying while Eurocom said it expects to pay about 32 million for its WCRS stake
Mr. Della Femina says he plans to remain heavily involved in the creative product at the world-wide agency serving as a sort of creative conscience
Louise McNamee Della Femina 's president will continue running the U.S. agency day-to-day
They and other top executives signed long-term employment contracts and Mr. Della Femina will receive an additional multimillion-dollar sum which some industry executives pegged at about 10 million
WCRS Group for its part will now be able to follow its longstanding plan of becoming a holding company for a series of media-related businesses said Peter Scott the firm 's chief executive
In addition to Carat WCRS will hold onto its public relations TV programming and other businesses
WCRS says its debt will be cut to 24 million from 66 million as a result of the transaction
For Carat meanwhile the alliance with Eurocom and WCRS is intended to strengthen its own push outside France
Carat 's Gross brothers invented the idea of large-scale buying of media space
By buying the space in bulk they obtain discounts as high as 50 % which they can pass on to customers
They thus have won the French space-buying business of such advertising giants as Coca-Cola Co. Fiat S.p
A. Gillette and Kodak
But now other agencies are getting into the business with their own competing media-buying groups and Carat wants to expand to the rest of Europe
To help finance the Carat purchase WCRS said it plans an issue of Euroconvertible preferred shares once the market settles down
But WCRS added that in the light of the current uncertainty in the equity markets it has arranged medium-term debt financing which would be underwritten by Samuel Montagu & Co. Ltd
Earthquake 's Damage Tuesday 's earthquake brought the San Francisco ad scene to a screeching halt yesterday with only a few staffers showing up at their offices mainly to survey the damage or to wring their hands about imminent new-business presentations
While no agencies reported injuries to employees the quake damaged the offices of J. Walter Thompson Chiat\/Day\/Mojo and DDB Needham among others spokesmen for those agencies said
Staffers at Thompson whose offices are in the ultramodern Embarcadero Center watched pictures drop from the walls and then felt the skyscraper sway seven to eight feet according to a spokeswoman
Plaster fell and windows were broken at Chiat\/Day\/Mojo a spokesman for that agency said
Late yesterday afternoon DDB Needham executives were scrambling to figure out what to do about a new business presentation that had been scheduled for today a spokesman said
DDB Needham 's office building may have sustained structural damage the spokesman added
All operations have stopped he said
A number of agencies including Thompson and Foote Cone & Belding said some employees who live outside of San Francisco fearful that they would n't be able to get home spent the night at the agency

One of the most remarkable features of the forced marches of the ethnic Turks out of Bulgaria over the past five months has been the lack of international attention
The deportation of more than 315,000 men women and children by the Bulgarian regime adds up to one of the largest migrations seen in the postwar years
Yet some people are advancing a chilling casuistry that what we are seeing is somehow the understandable result of the historical sins committed by the Turks in the 16th century
Today 's Turks in Bulgaria in other words deserve what is coming to them four centuries later
As if this were n't enough the Senate Judiciary Committee is getting into the act
On Tuesday it approved Senator Bob Dole 's proposed commemorative resolution designating April 24 1990 as the National Day of Remembrance of the 75th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923 suffered at the hands of the warring Ottoman Empire
There can be no quibbling that the Armenians endured terrible suffering but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve
It puts great strain on a longstanding U.S. friendship with Turkey a country that has been one of America 's strongest allies in NATO
The resolution also comes at a time when Turkey has been seeking help from the United States in resolving its Bulgarian emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the European Community
Turkey has been fighting its past for years and thus far has been only partially successful
Must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blames it for the genocide of another people Such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward Turkey that surfaced when Turkey asked for assistance in dealing with its Bulgarian emigration crisis
Mr. Dole 's odd effort notwithstanding most of Turkey 's political problems lie with the Europeans
Part of the problem some Europeans have with Turkey seems to stem from its location Turkey is n't really part of Europe
Why they wonder should it belong to the EC Another anti-Turkish hook is the Islamic faith of the majority of the Turkish people Turkey we are told is not a Christian nation its people simply wo n't fit in with the Western European Judeo-Christian tradition
It 's when these rationalizations fall on deaf ears that the old standby of retribution for treatment at the hands of the Ottoman Empire comes to the fore
No one has to accept the sins of the Ottoman Empire to reject that argument
Turkey in any event is long past it
The country has in recent years accepted more than 500,000 refugees from at least four bordering nations
Kurds suffering what many people consider to be a current extermination campaign at the hands of Syria Iran and Iraq have inundated eastern Turkey
Now it is their fellow Turks arriving as refugees from Bulgaria
The Turkish refugee tragedy and the ongoing crisis can not be ignored and shuttled off to that notorious dustbin of history that has become so convenient recently
Surely the past suffering of any people at any time can not be simply filed away and forgotten
But what the Senate Judiciary Committee has done in supporting the strongly worded Armenian resolution achieves no useful end it merely produces more controversy and embittered memories
Congress has enough difficulty dealing with the realities of the world as it currently exists
Bulgaria 's government has been behaving beyond the pale for months and the U.S. does its values no credit by ignoring that while casting its votes into the past
Many in Washington say President Bush will have to raise taxes to pay for his war on drugs
We have a better idea Dismantle HUD to pay for the war on drugs
Housing and Urban Development 's budget is 17 billion
From what we and the nation have been reading the money is n't being spent very well
The single most important contribution the government could make now to help the poor is to get the specter of drugs out of their neighborhoods
If that takes money take it away from this discredited federal department
But of course the Democrats pillorying HUD in hearings and in the press have no such solution in mind
Instead they 're scrambling to protect the very programs at the heart of the HUD scandal
This month HUD Secretary Jack Kemp unveiled a series of proposed reforms to improve management at HUD
No doubt many of his ideas are worthy but ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently
Congress is unlikely to go even that far
Last week Secretary Kemp ran into a buzzsaw of criticism from House Banking Committee members
They were appalled for instance that he wanted to target more of the 3 billion Community Development Block Grant CDBG program to low-income projects and zero out the notorious discretionary funds that have allowed HUD officials to steer contracts to political cronies
These development grants mainly enrich developers who want to put up shopping centers and parking garages
They also give those in Congress political credit for bringing home the pork and so they are popular with such Members as Mary Rose Oakar
Rep. Oakar a Democrat from Cleveland wants a 6.9 million grant so Cleveland can build an 18-story Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
She says it 'd create 600 jobs and bring Cleveland tourist revenue
HUD says the project does n't qualify and Mr. Kemp says that rock 'n' roll musicians and the music industry ought to put up the money
At the hearing Rep. Oakar started wailing about phoney baloney regulations that would stand between her and housing for downtown Cleveland
Rep. Chalmers Wylie an Ohio Republican rallied to the cause I think the gentlelady is making an important statement
The implication that if a congressman calls about a project in his district there 's something wrong I think is most unfortunate
We 're sure some theologian can explain the difference between what the Republican consultants have been doing with HUD and what these gentleladies and gentlemen want to do with HUD
Our view is that given Congress 's attitude toward HUD the place probably is beyond reform
For more than 50 years the federal government has tried various ways to provide housing for the poor and revive cities
In the process HUD has wasted untold billions created slums and invited corruption
Much of HUD 's spending actually is disguised welfare for developers or the middle class
That includes the CDBG funds and the Federal Housing Administration which loans out money for private home mortgages and has just been discovered to be 4 billion in the hole
Selling the FHA 's loan portfolio to the highest bidder would save the taxpayers untold billions in future losses
Some HUD money actually does trickle down to the poor and zeroing out housing middlemen would free up more money for public housing tenants to manage and even own their units
The rest ought to be used to clean out drugs from the neighbhorhoods
Rival gangs have turned cities into combat zones
Even suburban Prince George 's County Md. reported last week there have been a record 96 killings there this year most of them drug-related
Innocent bystanders often are the victims
A man in a wheelchair was gunned down in the crossfire of a Miami drug battle
A three-year-old Brooklyn boy was used as a shield by a drug dealer
Decent life in the inner cities wo n't be restored unless the government reclaims the streets from the drug gangs
Until then the billions HUD spends on inner-city housing simply is wasted
It 's still unclear whether Secretary Kemp wants to completely overhaul the engine room at HUD or just tighten a few screws here and there
No doubt he believes the place can be salvaged
Having seen the hypocrisy with which Congress has addressed the HUD scandals we disagree
It 's time to scrap the politically infested spending machine HUD has become and channel the resources into the drug war

Natural upheavals and most particularly earthquakes are not only horrible realities in and of themselves but also symbols through which the state of a society can be construed
The rubble after the Armenian earthquake a year ago disclosed quite literally a city whose larger structures had been built with sand
The extent of the disaster stemmed from years of chicanery and bureaucratic indifference
The larger parallel after the earthquake centered south of San Francisco is surely with the state of the U.S. economy
Did the stock-market tremors of Friday Oct. 13 presage larger fragility far greater upheavals Are the engineering and architecture of the economy as vulnerable as the spans of the Bay Bridge The eerie complacency of the Reagan-Bush era has produced Panglossian paeans about the present perfection of U.S. economic and social arrangements
A licensed government intellectual Francis Fukuyama recently announced in The National Interest that history is so to speak at an end since the course of human progress has now culminated in the glorious full stop of American civilization
His observations were taken seriously
But we are in reality witnessing the continuing decline of the political economy of capitalism not so much the end of history but the history of the end
The financial equivalent of the sand used by those Armenian contractors is junk bonds and the leveraged buy-outs associated with them
Builders get away with using sand and financiers junk when society decides it 's okay necessary even to look the other way
And by the early 1980s U.S. capitalists had ample reason to welcome junk bonds to look the other way
By that time they found extremely low profit rates from non-financial corporate investment
Government statistics in fact show that the profit rate net pretax profits divided by capital stock peaked in 1965 at 17.2 %
That same calculation saw profit rates fall to 4.6 % in the recession year 1982 and the supposed miracle that followed has seen the profit rate rise only to 8.1 % in 1986 and 8 % in 1987
Corresponding to the fall in profit rates was in the early 1980s the drop in the number arrived at if you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets the famous Q ratio associated with Prof. James Tobin
In theory the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same
But of course the market could decide that the firm 's capital stock its assets means nothing if the firm is not producing profits
This is indeed what the market decided
By 1982 the ratio was 43.5 % meaning that the market was valuing every dollar 's worth of the average firm 's assets at 43 cents
From the history of capitalism we can take it as a sound bet that if it takes only 43 cents to buy a dollar 's worth of a firm 's capital stock an alert entrepreneur wo n't look the other way
His assumption is that the underlying profitability rate will go up and the capital assets he bought on the cheap will soon be producing profits thus restoring the market 's faith in them
Hence the LBO craze
But here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet and where society was maybe foolish to look the other way
The profit rate is still low and the Q ratio was only 65 % in 1987 and 68.9 % in 1988
Result a landscape littered with lemons huge debt burdens crushing down upon the arch and spans of corporate America
The mounting risks did not go unobserved even in the mid-1980s
But there were enough promoters announcing the end of history in this case suspension of normal laws of economic gravity for society to continue shielding its eyes
Mainstream economists and commentators craning their necks up at the great pyramids of junk financing swiveling their heads to watch the avalanche of leveraged buy-outs claimed the end result would be a leaner meaner corporate America with soaring productivity and profits and the weaker gone to the wall
But this is not where the rewards of junk financing were found
The beneficiaries were those financiers whose icon was the topic figure of '80s capitalism Michael Milken 's 517 million salary in one year
Left-stream economists I associate with fellows in the Union of Radical Political Economists most particularly Robert Pollin of the economics faculty at the University of California at Riverside were not hypnotized in the manner of their pliant colleagues
All along they have been noting the tremors and pointing out the underlying realities
Profit rates after the great merger wave are no higher and now we have an extremely high-interest burden relative to cash flow
The consequences of building empires with sand are showing up
In contrast to previous estimates reckoning the default rate on junk bonds at 2 % or 3 % a Harvard study published in April of this year and discussed in a lead story in The Wall Street Journal for Sept. 18 found the default rate on these junk bonds is 34 %
What is the consequence of a high-interest burden high default rates and continued low profitability Corporations need liquidity in the form of borrowed funds
Without liquidity from the junk-bond market or cash flow from profits they look to the government which obediently assists the natural motions of the capitalist economy with charity in the form of cuts in the capital-gains tax rate or bailouts
The consequence can be inflation brought on as the effect of a desperate bid to avoid the deflationary shock of a sudden crash
Attacks on inflation come with another strategy of capital of a very traditional sort an assault on wages
Mr. Fukuyama peering through binoculars at the end of history said in his essay that the class issue has actually been successfully resolved in the West the egalitarianism of modern America represents the essential achievement of the classless society envisioned by Marx
Mr. Fukuyama might want to consult some American workers on the subject of class and egalitarianism
From its peak in 1972 of 198.41 the average American weekly wage had fallen to 169.28 in 1987 both figures being expressed in 1977 dollars
In other words after the glory boom of the Reagan years wages had sunk from the post World War II peak by 16 % as capitalists helped by the government turned down the screws or went offshore
But there are signs now the strikes by miners Boeing workers telephone workers etc. that this attack on wages is being more fiercely resisted
These are long-term Richter readings on American capitalism
The whole structure is extremely shaky
Governments have become sophisticated in handling moments of panic a word the London Times forbade my father to use when he was reporting the Wall Street crash in 1929
But sophistication has its limits
The S&L bailout could cost 300 billion computing interest on the government 's loans
These are real costs
Under what weights will the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation totter Capitalism may now be engineered to withstand sudden shocks but there are fault lines the crisis in profits the assault on wages the structural inequity of the system that make fools of those who claim that the future is here and that history is over

Japan Air Lines Lufthansa German Airlines and Air France reportedly plan to form an international air-freight company this year a move that could further consolidate the industry
Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that the three giants plan to integrate their cargo computers and ground-cargo and air-cargo systems
They reportedly will invest a total of 20 billion yen 140 million in the venture whose headquarters would be in France or West Germany
The action follows Federal Express Corp. 's acquisition of Flying Tiger Line Inc. in August
After that it would make sense for airlines to talk about doing things jointly said Cotton Daly director of cargo services for New York consulting firm Simat Helliesen & Eichner Inc
Mr. Daly said such discussions are motivated by the competitive threat posed by Federal Express United Parcel Service of America Inc. and other fast-growing air-freight companies
Many airlines are talking about cargo ventures and there have been rumors about such a tie between JAL and European airlines
In Tokyo a JAL spokesman said he could n't confirm or deny the latest Japanese report
But he said JAL is talking to Lufthansa and Air France about some sort of cargo venture
It is just one of a number of strategies JAL has embarked upon to come to terms with the situation in Europe after 1992 the deadline for ending trade barriers in the EC he said
In Frankfurt a Lufthansa spokesman confirmed talks are under way but declined to comment
A Lufthansa spokeswoman in Tokyo said the head of Lufthansa 's cargo operations had been in Toyko last week for talks with JAL
In Paris Air France declined to comment
Nothing is defined or signed at this point Mr. Daly said of the talks
Whatever accord the three carriers reach he said he is skeptical it would create a separate airline
If the three companies pool their air-freight businesses their clout would be considerable
According to figures from the International Air Transport Association they carried a combined 1.8 million tons of freight last year
Federal Express and Flying Tiger as separate companies carried a combined 2.6 million tons
Air France and Lufthansa last month concluded a far-reaching cooperation accord that includes air-freight activities
They plan to increase cooperation in freight ground-handling and create a world-wide computer system to process cargo
Other airlines would have access to the system they said and negotiations with partners were already under way
Both European airlines operate extensive fleets of Boeing 747 freighters and 747 Combis aircraft that carry both freight and passengers on the main deck
They currently have large orders for cargo planes
Several airlines including Lufthansa JAL and Cathay Pacific Airways are working on a so-called global cargo system and are trying to attract other carriers to join Mr. Daly said
JAL also has signaled it is looking for toeholds in Europe before the end of 1992
Last month the carrier said it wanted to lease crews and planes from British Airways so it could funnel its passengers from London to other European destinations
British Airways said it has n't received a proposal from JAL
But last week there were air-traffic negotiations between the U.K. and Japan a likely first step to any commercial agreement between JAL and British Airways or another U.K. carrier

In a move to prevent any dislocation in the financial markets from the California earthquake the Securities and Exchange Commission said it temporarily reassigned options listed on the Pacific Stock Exchange to the American New York and Philadelphia stock exchanges and to the Chicago Board Options Exchange
The decision which affects millions of dollars of trading positions was made late yesterday because the Pacific exchange 's options floor was shut down as a result of Tuesday 's earthquake
The SEC faced with a major squeeze on options positions said it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the exchange could be traded today and tomorrow
SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said the cooperation by the exchanges would enable investors to buy and sell options listed solely on the Pacific exchange guaranteeing the liquidity of the market
Officials at the four exchanges said well over 50 traders from the Pacific exchange were taking flights from San Francisco late yesterday to the American New York and Philadelphia exchanges and to the CBOE where they would continue making markets in the Pacific-listed options
The Big Board said carpenters quickly erected a new options floor to accomodate 40 traders from the Pacific exchange
In addition specialists on the exchanges agreed to provide backup capital for market-making in Pacific exchange options traded on the exchanges
Trading was light on the Pacific Stock Exchange yesterday with workers at the exchange 's main floor in San Francisco struggling to execute orders by flashlight as a result of a continuing power outage
The most pressing problem was the suspension of options trading
The Pacific exchange has options for 129 underlying stock issues including highly active Hilton Hotels Corp. which is listed on the Big Board
Investors were concerned that they might be unable to exercise options that expire tomorrow
But professionals said throughout the day that the shutdown would n't be a cause for alarm even if it were to persist for several days
I 've told my staff and clients that they still have the ability to exercise their options because they are guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corp. said Michael Schwartz a senior registered options strategist at Oppenheimer & Co
The SEC reassigned trading in the options however to allow investors to do more than simply exercise the options
While the exchange 's equities floor in San Francisco remained open on a limited basis orders were being routed and executed in Los Angeles
Workers could dial out but they could n't receive telephone calls
It 's a very uncertain situation right now said Navin Vyas administrative assistant of trading floor operations of the exchange which has daily volume of about 10 million shares
Because the exchange 's computer was rerouting orders to the exchange 's trading operations in Los Angeles business is as usual Mr. Vyas said
If one city is down the other can take over
Meanwhile the brokerage firms in San Francisco were trying to cope
Charles Daggs chairman and chief executive officer of Sutro & Co. said traders came to work at 5 a.m. PDT many on foot because of uncertain road and traffic conditions but learned that they would have to await a required inspection by the city in order to turn the power back on at the company 's two main facilities there
That should happen by today he said
Traders worked with the help of sunlight streaming through windows despite large cracks in the walls and a lack of incoming phone calls
Also most of the telecommunications equipment was out
The traders were executing municipal bond mutual fund and other orders through a sister firm Tucker Anthony Inc. which is also owned by John Hancock Freedom Securities but is based in New York
We are having a regular day
Volume is down out of San Francisco but not out of the 11 outlying offices Mr. Daggs added
Sutro 's Oakland office executed orders through the Sacramento office which was n't affected by the quake
Others like Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. which has eight offices in the San Francisco area set up an 800 number yesterday morning for customers to obtain market commentary and other help
At Kidder Peabody & Co. 's Sacramento branch Manager Janet White received calls yesterday morning from workers in San Francisco who offered to work in Sacramento
Then she discovered that Quotron Systems Inc. 's Sacramento lines were down because they are normally tied in through a system that goes through San Francisco
So the Kidder brokers had to call other company offices to get quotes on stocks
At Quotron the company 's National Call-In Center which swung into action for the first time last month for Hurricane Hugo assembled a tactical team at 5 a.m. yesterday to begin rerouting lines and restore service to brokers and traders
The company dispatched as many as 200 people in the San Francisco area to do the work though most of the rerouting was done by computer
Service appeared to be down throughout the financial district in downtown San Francisco while just parts of Oakland and San Jose were knocked out
But Dale Irvine director of the emergency center said service was being restored to outlying San Francisco areas
In Chicago yesterday Options Clearing confirmed that it guarantees the Pacific exchange options
The firm also will permit its members and the public to exercise their put and call options contracts traded on the Pacific exchange even if the exchange is closed said Wayne Luthringshausen chairman of Options Clearing
Put options give holders the right but not the obligation to sell a financial instrument at a specified price while call options give holders the right but not the obligation to buy a financial instrument at a specified price
Investors and traders in Pacific exchange options are protected to the extent that they can convert their put and call options into the underlying instrument Mr. Luthringshausen said
We are seeing such exercises today in fact
International Business Machines Corp. said its board approved the purchase of 1 billion of its common shares a move that should help support its battered stock
Even as the stock market has generally done well this year IBM 's shares have slipped steadily from its 52-week high of 130.875
Yesterday 's closing price of 101.75 down 50 cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange puts the stock at about 1 1\/2 times book value which is as low as it has sunk over the past decade
The announcement came after the market 's close
The move by IBM was n't exactly a surprise
The company has spent some 5 billion over the past 3 1\/2 years to buy back 42 million common shares or roughly 7 % of those outstanding
In addition despite IBM 's well-publicized recent problems the computer giant still generates enormous amounts of cash
As of the end of the second quarter it had 4.47 billion of cash and marketable securities on hand
As a result some securities analysts had predicted in recent days that IBM would authorize additional purchases
In Armonk N.Y. a spokesman said that although IBM did n't view its spending as necessarily a way to support the stock it thought the purchases were a good way to improve such financial measurements as per-share earnings and return on equity
We view it as a good long-term investment the spokesman said
In the short term the move is likely to have little effect
At yesterday 's closing price 1 billion would buy back about 10 million shares or less than 2 % of the roughly 580 million outstanding
In addition as of Sept. 30 the company still had authorization to buy 368 million of stock under a prior repurchase program
Over the long term however IBM 's stock repurchases along with its hefty 4.84-a-share annual dividend and generally loyal following among large institutional investors are providing a floor for the stock price
Although IBM last year produced its first strong results in four years and was expected to continue to roll this year it began faltering as early as January
First it had trouble manufacturing a chip for its mainframes IBM 's bread-and-butter business
Then it had a series of smaller glitches including problems manufacturing certain personal computers and the delay in the announcement of some important workstations
Finally IBM had to delay the introduction of some high-end disk drives which account for 10 % of its 60 billion of annual revenue
None of the problems is necessarily fatal and they are n't all necessarily even related
There are also other factors at work that are outside IBM 's control such as currency exchange rates
The strong dollar which reduces the value of overseas earnings and revenue when they are translated into dollars is expected to knock 80 to 85 cents off IBM 's per-share earnings for the full year
Without that problem IBM might have matched last year 's earnings of 5.81 billion or 9.80 a share
Still investors will take some convincing before they get back into IBM 's stock in a big way
Steve Milunovich a securities analyst at First Boston said that while investors were looking for an excuse to buy IBM shares a year ago even the big institutional investors are looking for a reason to avoid the stock these days
On Wall Street yesterday northern California 's killer earthquake was just another chance to make a buck
At the opening bell investors quickly began singling out shares of companies expected to profit or suffer in some way from the California disaster including insurers construction-related companies refiners and housing lenders
Brokerage houses jumped in touting post-quake demand stocks and Kidder Peabody & Co. set up a toll-free hot line for San Franciscans who might need emergency investment advice and help in transferring funds
Wall Street thinks of everything in terms of money says Tom Gallagher a senior Oppenheimer & Co. trader
However he added such event-driven trading moves typically last only a few hours and are often made without full information
The most popular plays of the day were insurance companies such as General Re Corp. which rose 2.75 to 86.50 Nac Re Corp. up 2 to 37.75 American International Group Inc. up 3.25 to 102.625 and Cigna Corp. up 87.5 cents to 62.50
Yesterday the brokerage firm Conning & Co. said insurers will use the earthquake as an excuse to raise insurance rates ending their long price wars
Before this bullish theory surfaced some insurance stocks initially fell indicating that investors thought the quake might cost insurers a lot of money
In fact Fireman 's Fund Corp. which ended the day off 50 cents to 36.50 said earthquake damage would slightly hurt fourth-quarter profit
On the prospect for rebuilding northern California investors bid up cement-makers Calmat Co. up 2.75 to 28.75 and Lone Star Industries Inc. up 1.75 to 29.25
Bridge and road builders had a field day including Kasler Corp. up 2.125 to 9.875 Guy F. Atkinson Co. up 87.5 to 61.875 and Morrison Knudsen Corp. which reported higher third-quarter earnings yesterday up 2.25 to 44.125
Fluor Corp. a construction engineering firm gained 75 cents to 33.375
But home-building stocks were a mixed bag
Timber stocks got a big boost
Georgia Pacific Corp. up 1.25 to 58 and Maxxam Inc. up 3 to 43.75 both reported strong profits
Merrill Lynch & Co. touted Georgia-Pacific Louisiana Pacific Corp. and Willamette Industries Inc. as the best post-quake plywood plays
Other gainers were companies with one or more undamaged California refineries
Tosco Corp. jumped 1.125 to 20.125 and Chevron Corp. despite a temporary pipeline shutdown rose 1 to 65
Meanwhile shares of some big housing lenders got hit on the likelihood that the lenders ' collateral people 's homes suffered physical damage and perhaps a loss in value
Wells Fargo & Co. fell 50 cents to 81.50 and BankAmerica Corp. fell 50 cents to 31.875
Some California thrift stocks also fell including Golden West Financial Corp. and H.F. Ahmanson & Co. which reported lower earnings yesterday
Property values did n't go up in California yesterday says one money manager
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. fell 37.5 cents to 19.625
One of its power generators was damaged though the company said there wo n't be any financial impact
Pacific Telesis Group lost 62.5 cents to 44.625
A computer failure delayed its earnings announcement and some investors think it might have extra costs to repair damaged telephone lines
Heavy construction property-casualty insurance and forest products were among the best performing industry groups in the Dow Jones Equity Market Index yesterday
Friday 's stock market plunge claimed its second victim among the scores of futures and options trading firms here
Petco Options an options trading firm owned by the family of the deceased former Chicago Board of Trade chairman Ralph Peters is getting out of the trade clearing or processing and guaranteeing business after sustaining a multimillion dollar loss Friday options industry officials said
Nearly 75 options traders on the Chicago Board Options Exchange who cleared trades through Petco including a handful of traders who lost between 500,000 to 1 million themselves as a result of Friday 's debacle are trying to transfer their business to other clearing firms CBOE members said
Timothy Vincent Petco chief executive officer confirmed that Petco was withdrawing from the clearing business
The owners of the company got a look at the potential risks in this business and after Monday they felt they did n't want to be exposed any more he said
He added that Petco remained in compliance with all industry capital requirements during the market 's rapid plunge Friday and Monday 's rebound
A CBOE spokeswoman declined comment on Petco
Over the weekend Fossett Corp. another options trading firm transferred the clearing accounts of about 160 traders to First Options of Chicago a unit of Continental Bank Corp. because it could n't meet regulatory capital requirements after Friday 's market slide
The unprecedented transfer of accounts underscored the options industry 's desire not to have its credibility tarnished by potentially widespread trading defaults on Monday
The CBOE American Stock Exchange Options Clearing Corp. and Stephen Fossett owner of Fossett joined in putting up 50 million to guarantee the accounts at First Options
The head of another small options clearing firm who asked not to be identified said that the heightened volatility in the financial markets in recent years makes it increasingly difficult for any but the largest financial trading firms to shoulder the risk inherent in the highly leveraged options and futures business
Prior to the introduction of financial futures in the late 1970s most trading firms clustered around the LaSalle Street financial district here were family operations handed down from one generation to the next
Most also were relatively undercapitalized compared with the size of most Wall Street securities firms
Mr. Peters a LaSalle Street legend among the post-World War II generation of commodity traders was rumored to have amassed a multimillion-dollar fortune from commodity trading and other activities by the time he died in May
Part of a Series Betty Lombardi is a mild-mannered homemaker and grandmother in rural Hunterdon County N.J
But put her behind a shopping cart and she turns ruthless
If Colgate toothpaste offers a tempting money-saving coupon she 'll cross Crest off her shopping list without a second thought
Never mind that her husband prefers Crest
Some weeks when her supermarket runs a double-coupon promotion she boasts that she shaves 22 off her bill
Money is n't the only thing that makes her dump once favorite brands
After she heard about the artery-clogging hazards of tropical oils in many cookies she dropped Pepperidge Farm and started buying brands free of such oils
I always thought Pepperidge Farm was tasty and high quality Mrs. Lombardi says
But I do n't want any of that oil for my grandkids
Pepperidge Farm says it ca n't tell exactly how many customers it has lost but it hopes to remove the objectionable tropical oil from all its products by year end
Clearly people like Mrs. Lombardi are giving marketers fits
She represents a new breed of savvy consumer who puts bargain prices nutritional and environmental concerns and other priorities ahead of old-fashioned brand loyalty
While brand loyalty is far from dead marketing experts say it has eroded during the 1980s
Marketers themselves are partly to blame They 've increased spending for coupons and other short-term promotions at the expense of image-building advertising
What 's more a flood of new products has given consumers a dizzying choice of brands many of which are virtually carbon copies of one other
Marketers have brought this on themselves with their heavy use of promotions contends Joe Plummer an executive vice president at the D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles ad agency
Without some real product improvements it 's going to be difficult to win that loyalty back
The Wall Street Journal 's American Way of Buying survey this year found that most consumers switch brands for many of the products they use
For the survey Peter D. Hart Research Associates asked some 2,000 consumers including Mrs. Lombardi whether they usually buy one brand of a certain type of product or have no brand loyalty
More than half the users of 17 of the 25 products included in the survey said they 're brand switchers
Overall 12 % of consumers are n't brand loyal for any of the 25 product categories
About 47 % are loyal for one to five of the products
Only 2 % are brand loyal in 16 to 20 of the categories and no one is loyal for more than 20 types of products
For such products as canned vegetables and athletic shoes devotion to a single brand was quite low with fewer than 30 % saying they usually buy the same brand
Only for cigarettes mayonnaise and toothpaste did more than 60 % of users say they typically stick with the same brand
People tend to be most loyal to brands that have distinctive flavors such as cigarettes and ketchup
Kathie Huff a respondent in the Journal survey from Spokane Wash. says her husband is adamant about eating only Hunt 's ketchup
He simply ca n't stomach the taste of Heinz she says
The 31-year-old homemaker adds The only other thing I 'm really loyal to is my Virginia Slims cigarettes
Coke and Pepsi are all the same to me and I usually buy whichever brand of coffee happens to be on sale
Brand imagery plays a significant role in loyalty to such products as cigarettes perfume and beer
People often stay with a particular brand because they want to be associated with the image its advertising conveys whether that 's macho Marlboro cigarettes or Cher 's Uninhibited perfume
Loyalty lags most for utilitarian products like trash bags and batteries
Only 23 % of trash-bag users in the Journal survey usually buy the same brand and just 29 % of battery buyers stick to one brand
Underwear scored a middling 36 % in brand loyalty but consumer researchers say that 's actually quite high for such a mundane product
In the past you just wore Fruit of the Loom and did n't care says Peter Kim U.S. director of consumer behavior research for the J. Walter Thompson ad agency
The high score reflects the attempts to make underwear more of a fashion image business for both men and women
He believes there 's opportunity for a smart gasoline marketer to create a strong brand image and more consumer loyalty
What loyalty there is to gas brands he believes is a matter of stopping at the most conveniently located service stations
Brand loyalty was stronger among older consumers in the Journal survey
Nearly one-fourth of participants age 60 and older claim brand loyalty for more than 10 of the 25 products in the survey only 9 % of those age 18 to 29 have such strong allegiance
Higher-income people also tend to be more brand loyal these days the Journal survey and other research studies indicate
Marketers speculate that more affluent people tend to lead more pressured lives and do n't have time to research the products they buy for the highest quality and most reasonable price
An established brand name is insurance that at least the product will be of acceptable quality if not always the best value for the money
It 's sort of loyalty by default
Meanwhile the bottom end of the market is becoming less loyal says Laurel Cutler vice chairman of the ad agency FCB\/Leber Katz Partners
They 're buying whatever 's cheaper
The biggest wild card in the brand loyalty game How those hotly pursued but highly unpredictable baby boomers will behave as they move into middle age
They grew up with more brand choices than any generation and have shown less allegiance so far
But now that they 're settling down and raising families might they also show more stability in their brand choices Mr. Kim of J. Walter Thompson does n't think so
He believes baby boomers will continue to be selective in their brand loyalties
Earlier generations were brand loyal across categories he says but boomers tend to be brand loyal in categories like running shoes and bottled water but less so in others like toilet paper and appliances
While not as brand loyal as in the past consumers today do n't buy products capriciously either
Rather they tend to have a set of two or three favorites
Sometimes they 'll choose Ragu spaghetti sauce other times it will be Prego
Advertisers attribute this shared loyalty to the striking similarity among brands
If a more absorbent Pampers hits the market you can be sure a new and improved Huggies wo n't be far behind
The BBDO Worldwide ad agency studied brand parity and found that consumers believe all brands are about the same in a number of categories particularly credit cards paper towels dry soups and snack chips
When there 's a clutter of brands consumers simplify the complexity by telling themselves All brands are the same so what difference does it make which I buy says Karen Olshan a senior vice president at BBDO
Too often advertising imagery has n't done a good job of forging a special emotional bond between a brand and the consumer
But given such strong brand disloyalty some marketers are putting renewed emphasis on image advertising
A small but growing number of companies are also trying to instill more fervent brand loyalty through such personalized direct-marketing ploys as catalogs magazines and membership clubs for brand users
While discount promotions are essential for most brands some companies concede they went overboard in shifting money from advertising to coupons refunds and other sales incentives
Some people argue that strong brands can afford to stop advertising for a time because of the residual impact of hundreds of millions of dollars spent on advertising through the years
But most companies are too afraid to take that chance
And perhaps with good reason
Says Clayt Wilhite president of the D'Arcy Masius ad agency 's U.S. division Every time 24 hours pass without any advertising reinforcement brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly even for a powerful brand like Budweiser
Consider for example what happened to Maxwell House coffee
The Kraft General Foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in 1987 and gave up several market share points and its leadership position in the coffee business
But since returning to advertising Maxwell House has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with archrival Folgers
Now Philip Morris Kraft General Foods ' parent company is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for Maxwell House says Dick Mayer president of the General Foods USA division
Even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee we need advertising to maintain and strengthen it
Campbell Soup Co. for one has concluded that it makes good sense to focus more on its most loyal customers than on people who buy competitive brands
The probability of converting a non-user to your brand is about three in 1,000 says Tony Adams the company 's vice president for marketing research
The best odds are with your core franchise
Our heavy users consume two to three cans of soup a week and we 'd like to increase that
So Campbell is talking to its brand enthusiasts probing their psychological attachment to its soup
In one consumer focus group a fan declared that Campbell 's soup is like getting a hug from a friend
That helped persuade the company to introduce a new advertising slogan A warm hug from Campbell 's
Insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week 's California earthquake
Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month
The earthquake 's toll including possible deep structural damage goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane says George Reider a vice president in Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. 's claims division
But investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake coming so soon after the hurricane will help stem more than two years of intense price-cutting wars among business insurers
Reflecting that logic insurance-company stocks posted strong gains
Aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage
Most insurers already have mobilized their catastrophe teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in northern California
Since commercial air travel is interrupted Aetna based in Hartford Conn. chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into Sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the Bay area
About 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon along with laptop computers cellular phones and blank checks
Some adjusters already in other parts of California drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claims-processing centers
Insurers will be advertising 800 numbers probably on the radio that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. the largest home and auto insurer in California believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the 475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo
State Farm based in Bloomington Ind. is also the largest writer of personal-property earthquake insurance in California
Earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement rider on a homeowner 's policy in California because of the area 's vulnerability to earthquakes
State Farm said about 25 % of its policyholders in California have also purchased earthquake insurance
Allstate Insurance Co. a unit of Sears Roebuck & Co. said about 23 % of its personal property policyholders about 28 % in the San Franciso area also have earthquake coverage
The Association of California Insurance Companies estimated damage to residential property could total 500 million but only 100 million to 150 million is insured it said
Officials from the American Insurance Association 's property-claim service division which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster will be flying to San Francisco today
They expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two
Roads and bridges in the Bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage
Highways such as the section of Interstate 880 that collapsed in Oakland generally do n't have insurance coverage
Industry officials say the Bay Bridge unlike some bridges has no earthquake coverage either so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds
However the bridge which charges a 1 toll each way does have loss of income insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days
That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including Fireman 's Fund Corp. based in Novato Calif. and Cigna Corp. based in Philadelphia
Earthquake-related claims are n't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole
Instead even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear
Indeed the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways
For example insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy
Such increased demand for reinsurance along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise
Reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves
We are saying this is the breaking point this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace said William Yankus an analyst with Conning & Co. a Hartford firm that specializes in the insurance industry
His firm along with some others issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday
Among the insurance stocks big gainers included American International Group up 3.25 to 102.625 General Re Corp. up 2.75 to 86.50 Aetna up 2.375 to 59.50 and Marsh & McLennan Inc. up 3.125 to 75.875
Still a few individual companies most likely smaller ones could be devastated
I think there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this said Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Myron Picoult
He suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by Hurricane Hugo
British West German Scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the San Francisco earthquake disaster
Although it 's unclear how much exposure the London market will face U.K. underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to U.S. catastrophe coverage
Jack Byrne chairman of Fireman 's Fund said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market causing these rates to soar
The catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflation-adjusted basis since 1906 when another earthquake sparked the Great San Francisco Fire
Orin Kramer an insurance consultant in New York estimates that the 1906 San Francisco destruction on an inflation-adjusted basis included insured losses of 5.8 billion
He is estimating this week 's disaster will generate insured losses of 2 billion to 4 billion following about 4 billion in costs to insurers from Hurricane Hugo
Silicon Graphics Inc. 's first-quarter profit rose sharply to 5.2 million or 28 cents a share from 1 million or six cents a share a year ago
The maker of computer workstations said a surge of government orders contributed to the increase
Revenue rose 95 % to 86.4 million from 44.3 million the year earlier
In national over-the-counter trading the company closed yesterday at 23.25 a share down 25 cents
Hunter Environmental Services Inc. said it reached a preliminary accord on the sale of its environmental consulting and services business for about 40 million and assumption of related debt
The buyer was n't identified
The company said it also is making progress in negotiating the buy-out of its design division by management
In addition Hunter said it will use proceeds from a private placement of 8 million of preferred shares to purchase an interest in a start-up company to underwrite environmental impairment insurance
Hunter wants to concentrate its resources on the insurance business and on a project to store hazardous wastes in salt domes
Jaguar PLC 's chairman said he hopes to reach a friendly pact with General Motors Corp. within a month that may involve the British luxury-car maker 's producing a cheaper executive model
Sir John Egan told reporters at London 's Motorfair yesterday he would be disappointed if we could n't do the deal within a month
He said the tie-up would mean Jaguar could develop cars down range in price from where we are by offering access to GM 's high-volume parts production
Besides creating joint manufacturing ventures the accord is expected to give GM about a 15 % stake that eventually would rise to about 30 %
Jaguar figures a friendly alliance with GM will fend off unwelcome advances from Ford Motor Co
But Ford Jaguar 's biggest shareholder since lifting its stake to 10.4 % this week is pressing harder for talks with Sir John
We 're getting to the point where we are going to have to meet with him one Ford official said yesterday
Ford probably will renew its request for such a meeting soon he added
Sir John has spurned Ford 's advances since the U.S. auto giant launched a surprise bid for as much as 15 % of Jaguar last month
Ford has signaled it might acquire a majority interest later
I 'm not obligated to sit down and talk to anybody the Jaguar chairman asserted yesterday
He did n't rule out negotiations with Ford however
The fiercely proud but financially strapped British company prefers to remain independent and publicly held despite Ford 's promise of access to cash and technological know-how
Sir John noted that GM a longtime Jaguar supplier agrees we should remain an independent company
He said Jaguar started negotiating with GM and several other car makers over a year ago but the rest dropped by the wayside ever since the share price went above 4 6.30 a share
Jaguar shares stood at 405 pence before Ford 's initial announcement but the subsequent takeover frenzy has driven them up
The stock traded late yesterday on London 's stock exchange at 673 pence up 19 pence
Developing an executive-model range would mark a major departure for Britain 's leading luxury-car maker
A typical British executive car is mass produced and smaller than a luxury car
It generally fetches no more than 25,000 39,400 roughly 16,000 less than the highest-priced Jaguars which are all known for their hand-crafted leather work
We have designs for such executive cars but have never been able to develop them Sir John said
GM 's help would make it possible for Jaguar to build a wider range of cars
An executive model would significantly boost Jaguar 's yearly output of 50,000 cars
You are talking about a couple hundred thousand a year said Bob Barber an auto-industry analyst at U.K. brokerage James Capel & Co
A pact with GM may emerge in as little as two weeks according to sources close to the talks
The deal would require approval by a majority of Jaguar shareholders
We have to make it attractive enough that holders would accept it Sir John said
That may be difficult the Jaguar chairman acknowledged when you have somebody else breathing down your neck
Ford probably would try to kill the proposal by enlisting support from U.S. takeover-stock speculators and holding out the carrot of a larger bid later said Stephen Reitman European auto analyst at London brokers UBS Phillips & Drew
Ford ca n't make a full-fledged bid for Jaguar until U.K. government restrictions expire
The anti-takeover measure prevents any outside investor from buying more than 15 % of Jaguar shares without permission until Dec. 31 1990
But with its 10.4 % stake Ford can convene a special Jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions prematurely
It 's a very valuable weapon in their armory which could enable Ford to bid sooner for Jaguar observed Mr. Barber of James Capel
Otherwise Jaguar may have to tolerate the two U.S. auto giants each owning a 15 % stake for more than a year
It would be difficult to see how a car company can be owned by a collective Sir John said
It has never been done before but there 's always a first
Although two Baby Bells showed strong growth in access lines usage and unregulated business revenue one reported a modest gain in third-quarter net while the other posted a small drop
Ameritech Corp. 's earnings increased 2.8 % after strong revenue gains were offset somewhat by refunds and rate reductions imposed by regulators in its Midwest territory
BellSouth Corp. 's third-quarter earnings dropped 3.8 % as a result of debt refinancing the recent acquisition of a cellular and paging property and rate reductions in its Southeast territory
BellSouth At BellSouth based in Atlanta customer access lines grew by 162,000 or 3.5 % during the 12-month period ended Sept
For the third quarter total operating revenue grew 2.6 % to 3.55 billion from 3.46 billion
Total operating expenses increased 3.5 % to 2.78 billion from 2.69 billion
Overall access minutes of use increased 10.3 % and toll messages jumped 5.2 %
BellSouth Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John L. Clendenin said three factors accounted for the drop in third-quarter earnings
The refinancing of 481 million in long-term debt reduced net income by 22 million or five cents a share but in the long run will save more than 250 million in interest costs
The company previously said that the recent acquisition of Mobile Communications Corp. of America would dilute 1989 earnings by about 3 %
In addition earnings were reduced by rate reductions in Florida Kentucky Alabama Tennessee and Louisiana
Ameritech At Ameritech based in Chicago customer access lines increased by 402,000 or 2.6 % and cellular mobile lines increased by 80,000 or 62.3 % for the 12-month period ended Sept. 30
For the third quarter revenue increased 1.9 % to 2.55 billion from 2.51 billion
Operating expenses increased 2.6 % to 2.04 billion including one-time pretax charges of 40 million for labor contract signing bonuses
Local service revenue increased 3.5 % and directory and unregulated business revenue jumped 9.5 %
But network access revenue dropped 4 % and toll revenue dropped 1.4 %

b reflects extraordinary loss of five cents a share for early debt retirement
c reflects extraordinary loss of five cents a share and extraordinary gain of 14 cents a share from cumulative effect of accounting change
The Wall Street Journal American Way of Buying Survey consists of two separate door-to-door nationwide polls conducted for the Journal by Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization
The two surveys which asked different questions were conducted using national random probability samples
The poll conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates interviewed 2,064 adults age 18 and older from June 15 to June 30 1989
The poll conducted by the Roper Organization interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from July 7 to July 15 1989
Responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with U.S. Census data
For each poll the odds are 19 out of 20 that if pollsters had sought to survey every household in the U.S. using the same questionnaire the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than 2 1\/2 percentage points in either direction
The margin of error for subgroups for example married women with children at home would be larger
In addition in any survey there is always the chance that other factors such as question wording could introduce errors into the findings
Program traders were buying and selling at full steam Monday the first trading session after the stock market 's 190.58-point plunge Friday
They accounted for a hefty 16 % of New York Stock Exchange volume Monday the fourth busiest session ever
On Friday 13 % of volume was in computer-guided program trades
In August by contrast program trading averaged 10.3 % of daily Big Board turnover
Program traders were publicly castigated following the 508-point crash Oct. 19 1987 and a number of brokerage firms pulled back from using this strategy for a while
But as the outcry faded by the spring of 1988 they resumed
Some observers thought that after Friday 's sharp drop the firms would rein in their program traders to avoid stoking more controversy
But the statistics released yesterday show the firms did nothing of the sort
One reason they said was that the official reports on the 1987 crash exonerated program trading as a cause
Stock-index arbitrage is the most controversial form of program trading because it accelerates market moves if not actually causing them
In it traders buy or sell stocks and offset those positions in stock-index futures contracts to profit from fleeting price discrepancies
Under the exchange 's definitions program trading also describes a number of other strategies that in the opinion of some traders do n't cause big swings in the market
The Big Board 's disclosure of program trading activity on these two days was unusual
Though it collects such data daily its monthly reports on program trading usually come out about three weeks after each month ends
The September figures are due to be released this week
The Big Board declined to name the Wall Street firms involved in the activity Friday and Monday or the type of strategies used
But traders on the exchange floor who can observe the computer-guided trading activity on monitor screens said most of the top program-trading firms were active both days
Through August the top five program trading firms in volume were Morgan Stanley & Co. Kidder Peabody & Co. Merrill Lynch & Co. PaineWebber Group Inc. and Salomon Brothers Inc
Though brokerage officials defended their use of program trading one sign of what an issue it remains was that few executives would comment on the record
Besides reciting the pardon for program trading contained in the Brady Commission report they said stock-index arbitrage was actually needed Monday to restore the markets ' equilibrium
On Friday the stock-index futures market was unhinged from the stock market when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange halted trading in Standard & Poor 's 500 futures contract a circuit breaker procedure instituted after the 1987 crash and implemented for the first time
Futures trading resumed a half-hour later but the session ended shortly thereafter leaving the stock market set up for more sell programs traders said
By Monday morning they said stock-index arbitrage sell programs helped re-establish the link between stocks and futures
But stunning volatility was produced in the process
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged a breathtaking 63.52 points in the first 40 minutes of trading Monday as stock-index arbitrage sell programs kicked in
At about 10:10 a.m. EDT the market abruptly turned upward on stock-index arbitrage buy programs
By day 's end the Dow industrials had rebounded 88.12 points or nearly half of Friday 's drop
FREDERICK 'S OF HOLLYWOOD Inc. Los Angeles said its board voted a 50 % increase in the specialty boutique-store operator 's semiannual dividend to five cents a common share
The dividend is payable Dec. 15 to stock of record Nov. 15
Valley National Corp. reported a third-quarter net loss of 72.2 million or 3.65 a share and suspended its quarterly dividend because of potential losses on its Arizona real estate holdings
The Phoenix-based holding company for Arizona 's largest bank said it added 121 million to its allowance for losses on loans and for real estate owned
The company earned 18.7 million or 95 cents a share a year earlier
For the nine months Valley National posted a net loss of 136.4 million or 6.90 a share
It had profit of 48.6 million or 2.46 a share in the 1988 period
Valley National had been paying a quarterly dividend of 36 cents a share
The Arizona real estate market continues to be depressed and there is still uncertainty as to when values will recover James P. Simmons chairman said
The decision to increase the loan-loss reserve and suspend the dividend is both prudent and in the best long-term interest of the shareholders he said
Valley National said it made the decision on the basis of an overall assessment of the marketplace and the condition of its loan portfolio and after reviewing it with federal regulators
The addition to reserves comes on top of a provision of 199.7 million that was announced in June
In July Moody 's downgraded 400 million of the company 's debt saying the bank holding company had n't taken adequate write-offs against potential losses on real estate loans despite its second-quarter write-down
Richard M. Greenwood Valley National 's executive vice president said then that the company believed the write-downs were adequate and did n't plan to increase its reserves again
Bruce Hoyt a banking analyst with Boettcher & Co. a Denver brokerage firm said Valley National is n't out of the woods yet
The key will be whether Arizona real estate turns around or at least stabilizes he said
They 've stepped up to the plate to take the write-downs but when markets head down a company is always exposed to further negative surprises Mr. Hoyt said
Valley National closed yesterday at 24.25 a share down 1 in national over-the-counter trading
Two years of coddling down the drain
That 's the way a lot of brokers feel today on the second anniversary of the 1987 stock-market crash
Ever since that fearful Black Monday they 've been tirelessly wooing wary individual investors trying to convince them that Oct. 19 1987 was a fluke and that the stock market really is a safe place for average Americans to put their hard-earned dollars
And until last Friday it seemed those efforts were starting to pay off
Some of those folks were coming back says Leslie Quick Jr. chairman of discount brokers Quick & Reilly Group Inc
We had heard from people who had n't been active for a long time
Then came the frightening 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a new wave of stock-market volatility
All of a sudden it was back to square one
It 's going to set things back for a period because it reinforces the concern of volatility says Jeffrey B. Lane president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc
I think it will shake confidence one more time and a lot of this business is based on client confidence
Brokers around the country say the reaction from individual investors this week has been almost eerie
Customers and potential customers are suddenly complaining about the stock market in the exact way they did in post-crash 1987
The kinds of questions you had before have resurfaced says Raymond A. Chip Mason chairman of regional brokerage firm Legg Mason Inc. Baltimore
I can just tell the questions are right back where they were What 's going on Ca n't anything be done about program trading Does n't the exchange understand Where is the SEC on this Mr. Mason says he 's convinced the public still wants to invest in common stocks even though they believe the deck is stacked against them
But these wide swings scare them to death
All of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as Shearson and Merrill Lynch & Co. that have big retail or individual-investor businesses
After expanding rapidly during the bull-market years up to the 1987 crash retail brokerage operations these days are getting barely enough business to pay the overhead
True the amount of money investors are willing to entrust to their brokers has been growing lately
But those dollars have been going into such safe products as money market funds which do n't generate much in the way of commissions for the brokerage firms
At discount brokerage Charles Schwab & Co. such cash-equivalent investments recently accounted for a record 8 billion of the firm 's 25 billion of client 's assets
The brokers ' hope has been that they could soon coax investors into shifting some of their hoard into the stock market
And before last Friday they were actually making modest progress
A slightly higher percentage of New York Stock Exchange volume has been attributed to retail investors in recent months compared with post-crash 1988 according to Securities Industry Association data
In 1987 an average 19.7 % of Big Board volume was retail business with the monthly level never more than 21.4 %
The retail participation dropped to an average 18.2 % in 1988 and shriveled to barely 14 % some months during the year
Yet in 1989 retail participation has been more than 20 % in every month and was 23.5 % in August the latest month for which figures are available
Jeffrey Schaefer the SIA 's research director says that all of his group 's retail-volume statistics could be overstated by as much as five percentage points because corporate buy-backs are sometimes inadvertently included in Big Board data
But there did seem to be a retail activity pickup
But Friday did n't help things says Mr. Schaefer
With the gyrations of recent days says Hugo Quackenbush senior vice president at Charles Schwab many small investors are absolutely convinced that they should n't play in the stock market
Joseph Grano president of retail sales and marketing at PaineWebber Group Inc. still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market
Investors will develop thicker skins and their confidence will return he says
Friday 's plunge he is telling PaineWebber brokers was nothing more than a tremendous reaction to leveraged buy-out stocks
Meanwhile PaineWebber remains among the leaders in efforts to simply persuade investors to keep giving Wall Street their money
It 's more of an important issue to keep control of those assets rather than push the investor to move into specific products such as equities Mr. Grano says
The equity decision will come when the client is ready and when there 's a semblance of confidence
It could be a long wait say some industry observers
Some investors will tiptoe back in says Richard Ross a market research director for Elrick & Lavidge in Chicago
Then there 'll be another swing
Given enough of these this will drive everyone out except the most hardy he adds
Mr. Ross who has been studying retail investors ' perception of risks in the brokerage industry said a market plunge like Friday 's shatters investors confidence in their ability to make any judgments on the market
The long-term outlook for the retail brokerage business is miserable Mr. Ross declares

Continental Airlines is a unit of Texas Air Corp
John V. Holmes an investment-newsletter publisher and three venture-capital firms he organized were enjoined from violating the registration provisions of the securities laws governing investment companies
As part of an agreement that settled charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission a receiver was also appointed for the three venture-capital firms
Mr. Holmes was the subject of a page one profile in The Wall Street Journal in 1984 after the SEC questioned him about ties between him and companies he touted in a newsletter
In 1986 in another consent agreement with the SEC Mr. Holmes was enjoined from violating the stock-registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws
Without any admission or denial of guilt by Mr. Holmes that agreement settled SEC charges that Mr. Holmes sold unregistered securities and misled investors
In charges filed last week in federal district court in Charlotte N.C. the SEC alleged that Venture Capitalists Inc. Venture Finance Corp. and New Ventures Fund Inc. all of Charlotte failed repeatedly to file proper documents
The SEC also charged that Mr. Holmes acted as an officer or director of New Ventures in violation of his previous consent agreement
Some companies were delinquent in filings and other actions all of which cost money Mr. Holmes said
Two of Mr. Holmes 's business associates who worked for Venture Capitalists Kimberly Ann Smith and Frederick Byrum also consented to being enjoined from violations of registration provisions of the securities laws
Ms. Smith also agreed to a permanent injunction barring her from acting as an officer director or investment adviser of any mutual fund unit investment trust or face-amount certificate company
Mr. Byrum and Ms. Smith could n't be reached for comment
In consenting to the injunctions none of the individuals or companies admitted or denied the allegations
Senate Republicans have settled on a proposal that would cut the capital-gains tax for individuals and corporations
At the same time a small group of Senate Democrats are working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon
Sen. Bob Packwood R. Ore. the lead sponsor of the GOP proposal said he intends to unveil the plan today and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation comes along particularly this month 's bill to raise the federal borrowing limit
He gave 10-to-1 odds that a capital-gains tax cut of some sort would be approved this year though it probably wo n't be included in the pending deficit-reduction bill
He added that he expects to talk to the Democrats who also wanted to cut the gains tax about drafting a joint proposal
For individuals the Packwood plan would exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year
The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of 35 %
The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1 1989
As an alternative he said taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index
For corporations the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 % from the current top rate of 34 %
That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years
The Packwood plan would also include a proposal designed by Sen. William Roth R. Del. that would expand and alter the deduction for individual retirement accounts
The Roth plan would create a new non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement but also for the purchase of a first home and to pay education and medical expenses
Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs but would be subject to tax
For their part the group of Democrats are working on a plan that like the Packwood proposal would grant larger exclusions to assets the longer they were held by individuals and companies
Newly acquired assets would get a bigger break than those currently held
An extra exclusion would be given to long-held stock in small and medium-size corporations just starting up
No one in the Senate is considering the capital-gains plan passed by the House
That plan would provide a 30 % exclusion to assets sold over a 2 1\/2-year period ending Dec. 31 1991
After then the House measure would boost the tax rate to 28 % and exclude from tax the gain attributable to inflation
Senators are focusing on making a capital-gains differential permanent
Separately Chairman Dan Rostenkowski D. Ill
of the House Ways and Means Committee said he did n't want the capital-gains tax cut or any other amendments attached to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit
The current debt limit expires Oct. 31
He also urged House and Senate negotiators to rid the deficit-reduction bill of all provisions that increase the budget deficit including the House-passed capital-gains provision
From a helicopter a thousand feet above Oakland after the second-deadliest earthquake in U.S. history a scene of devastation emerges a freeway crumbled into a concrete sandwich hoses pumping water into once-fashionable apartments abandoned autos
But this quake was n't the big one the replay of 1906 that has been feared for so many years
Despite the tragic loss of more than 270 lives and damage estimated in the billions most businesses and their plants and offices in the Bay area were n't greatly affected
The economic life of the region is expected to revive in a day or two although some transportation problems may last weeks or months
A main factor mitigating more widespread damage was the location of the quake 's epicenter 20 miles from the heart of the Silicon Valley and more than 50 miles from downtown San Francisco and Oakland
Also the region 's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage
The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance so that most parts of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage broken windows falling brick and cornices buckled asphalt or sidewalks
Of course the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned Silicon Valley into the nation 's capital of high technology
Like other major American cities the San Francisco Oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world 's great natural harbors
When the tremors struck the region 's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air
Michael L. Bandler vice president for network technology at Pacific Bell Telephone Co. says nearly all the network 's computer switches which move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another changed to battery power when the city lost power
The battery packs have enough power for only three hours but that gave emergency crews time to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel
Of some 160 switches in Pacific Bell 's network only four went down
One of those was in Hollister Calif. near the earthquake 's epicenter
Few telephone lines snapped
That 's because the widely used fiber-optic cable has been installed underground with 25 extra feet of cable between junction points
The slack absorbs the pulling strain generated by an earthquake
Nevertheless phone service was sporadic many computer terminals remained dark and by late yesterday a third of San Francisco remained without power
Business in the nation 's fourth-largest metropolitan region was nearly paralyzed an estimated one million members of the work force stayed at home
The economic dislocation was as abrupt as the earthquake itself as virtually all businesses shut down
The 125-billion-a-year Bay area economy represents one-fourth of the economy of the nation 's most populous state and accounts for 2 % to 3 % of the nation 's total output of goods and services according to the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto
In high-tech the Bay area accounts for 15 % to 20 % of the U.S. computer-related industry
This has been a major disruption for the Bay area economy says Pauline Sweezey the chief economist at the California Department of Finance
Obviously things are going to have to go on hold for many companies
The damage to the Bay area 's roadways could cause significant economic hardship
A quarter of a million people cross the Bay Bridge every day far more than the 100,000 that use the Bay Area Rapid Transit system BART which was working but was n't stopping in the city 's Financial District yesterday afternoon because electricity was shut off and the area was being checked for gas leaks
California state transportation officials interviewed by telephone say they nevertheless do n't expect serious problems for commerce in and out of the Bay area
All major roadways except Interstate 880 known as the Nimitz Freeway and the Bay Bridge were open by 1 p.m. yesterday
Officials expect difficulty routing traffic through downtown San Francisco
The earthquake caused many streets to buckle and crack making them impassible
Other roads were obstructed by collapsed buildings and damaged water and power lines an emergency relief spokesman says
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos estimated the damage to his city alone at 2 billion
But many predicted that the commercial disruption would be short-lived
Of the scores of companies contacted by this newspaper few reported any damage that they did n't expect to have remedied within a day or two
It is possible of course that some of the most seriously damaged companies could n't be reached particularly in areas nearest the epicenter
Typical perhaps was the situation at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. the General Motors Corp.-Toyota joint-venture auto plant in Fremont about 35 miles south of Oakland
Ten of the plant 's workers were injured when the quake hit about a half-hour into the afternoon shift seven were hospitalized
Metal racks on the plant floor fell over and water mains ruptured a spokeswoman says
The plant was evacuated and workers sent home
But the plant was able to resume limited production of its Toyota Corollas and Geo Prizms by 6 a.m. yesterday and absenteeism was only 7 % of the work force about twice normal
Computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. based in Palo Alto says one of its buildings sustained severe damage when it was knocked off its foundation
Other buildings had broken glass dangling light fixtures and broken pipes a spokesperson says estimating the cost of reconstruction in the millions
Most banks were closed but were expected to reopen today with few problems anticipated
At the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Vice President Robert Fienberg says operations were steaming along as usual yesterday afternoon
When the quake hit we turned on our emergency generator and brought our computers up he says
The Fed serves as a middleman for banks taking checks from one bank and sending them to another an operation that it handled smoothly Tuesday night after the quake
The volume we received from the banks was a lot lower than usual he says
A disaster-contingency plan in which the Los Angeles Fed would come to San Francisco 's aid was n't needed he adds
Most of the telephone problems in the immediate aftermath stemmed from congestion
The telephone network simply could n't handle the large number of people seeking to make a call at the same time
The volume resulted in dial-tone delays that were as short as 15 seconds and as long as five minutes
Mr. Bandler puts traffic volume at 10 to 50 times normal
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. MCI Communications Inc. and United Telecommunications ' U S Sprint unit were blocking phone calls into the Bay area to alleviate congestion
The companies block traffic much as highway on-ramps are blocked when traffic backs up
William E. Downing Pacific Bell 's vice president of customer services for the Bay area says most long-distance companies were blocking about 50 % of all calls
Pacific Telesis says its Pacific Bell unit also was blocking about 50 % of its calls locally
Ironically the long-term effect of the earthquake may be to bolster the Bay area 's economic fortunes and indeed the nation 's gross national product
It may also lead to new safeguards in major construction projects such as double-deck highways
It would in the near-term give a boost to the San Francisco economy because there will be an influx of people to help says Beth Burnham Mace a regional economist at DRI\/McGraw Hill a Lexington Mass. forecasting firm
The construction industry is sure to feel increased demand
There will be a big influx of federal dollars and gains in state federal and local employment Ms. Mace says
Adds Stacy Kotman an economist at Georgia State University There 's nothing positive about an earthquake but it will probably generate more construction activity
Wall Street reacted swiftly yesterday to the disaster by bidding up stocks of construction and related companies
Shares of Lone Star Industries Inc. a cement maker rose sharply in anticipation of stepped-up demand
In Greenwich Conn. Lone Star spokesman Michael London says Obviously with an earthquake of this size there are likely to be construction projects that would n't otherwise have been anticipated
But any increase is n't likely to be any kind of a surge
It 's something likely to be spread out over a long period of time
There will be a lot of repair work that wo n't require the quantities of cement or concrete that new constructon would
Lone Star 's San Francisco facilities were n't damaged in the quake
The earthquake is likely to reduce GNP negligibly in the near term and then could raise it a bit as rebuilding begins
The first effects are of course negative as work is disrupted and people lose income and cut spending
Corporate profits may also dip initially
Many of the lost tourism dollars wo n't be recovered many trips delayed never take place
Subsequently however the ill effects are likely to be offset at least in economic terms as construction activity begins
Because of the way the government keeps its books the damage to the Bay Bridge however costly wo n't be counted as a minus
The money spent on repairs will be counted as a plus
It 's very difficult to model the long-term impact of this says Andrew Goldberg who studies the public-policy and crisis-management aspects of earthquakes at the Center for Strategic International Studies in Washington D.C
You certainly can say it 's going to be extremely severe
We really are talking about shutting down a major American city for a number of days maybe for a few weeks
Mr. Goldberg says the cost of the earthquake will definitely top 1 billion and could reach 4 billion
He cautions that early damage estimates are often low the damage totals in Hurricane Hugo increased tenfold as more information was received
The earthquake damage of course would have been far greater if the epicenter had been in downtown San Francisco
A direct hit on a major city Mr. Goldberg figures would cause 20 billion to 40 billion of damage
Experts caution that it is far too soon for reliable estimates of the quake 's total damage but it 's clear that insurers are likely to pay out enormous sums
Jack Byrne the chairman of Fireman 's Fund Corp. which is based in Novato Calif. estimates insured losses resulting the earthquake could total 2 billion
The impact on the insurance industry will be big and harsh but less than Hurricane Hugo says Mr. Byrne who toured the Bay area by car yesterday afternoon to get a sense of the company 's exposure to the earthquake
Mr. Byrne says Fireman 's Fund will probably pay hundreds of millions in primary claims but after taxes and use of its reinsurance lines the company 's fourthquarter charge against earnings should n't top 50 million
The company was able to assess its damage liability quickly because it has computerized maps of Northern California showing the exact locations of all the property it insures
Fireman 's Fund had claims adjusters on the streets of San Francisco right after sunrise yesterday and was paying as many claims as it could right on the spot
Fireman 's Fund insures 37,300 homes and autos and 35,000 businesses in the Bay area
In addition to paying for earthquake and fire damage the insurer must cover worker-compensation claims and also losses due to businesses being shut down by lack of power or phone service
But many Californians may not have adequate insurance coverage to pay for damages to their property
The Independent Insurance Agents of America says fewer than one of every five California homeowners has earthquake insurance
A somewhat higher percentage of people living in the Bay area have bought the additional insurance protection but the great majority are n't covered
Earthquake insurance typically runs 200 or more a year for a small house
Whatever the long-term economic effect the scene from the helicopter above Oakland is one of tragedy
Gargantuan sections of a double-decker freeway have been heaved about like plastic building blocks
Atop them sit cars and trucks abandoned in a terrifying scramble to safety the day before
In areas where the freeway made giant concrete sandwiches of itself lie cars that police say have been flattened into foot-thick slabs
On the periphery rescue workers seem from the air to move in slow motion
They peck away at the 1 1\/2-mile section of rubble searching for more of the 250 people thought to have died here
About 20 other deaths were also attributed to the earthquake
The heart of the earthquake 6.9 on the Richter scale was 50 miles to the south near Santa Cruz but its terrible fist struck here on the Nimitz Freeway a major artery serving the Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco
Along the way the quake toppled a mall in Santa Cruz knocked down buildings in San Francisco 's fashionable Marina District and sent a wall of bricks crashing on motorists in the city 's Financial District
Just a short span across the bay to the west the quake also showed its mettle A four-square-block area of the Marina District lies smoldering under a steady stream of seawater being pumped onto rubble to prevent it from blazing anew
Many of the buildings mostly condominiums and apartments were flattened almost instantly as the underlying soil much of it landfill was literally turned to ooze by the quake 's intensive shaking rupturing gas lines
Onlookers say three persons died when one of the buildings exploded into a fireball shortly after the quake struck
Efforts to fight the blaze were hampered because water mains were severed as well
From the air ribbons of yellow fire hose carry water from the bay to high-pressure nozzles trained on the site
As onlookers stand behind barricades helmeted firemen and building inspectors survey rows of nearby buildings that were twisted from their foundations and seem on the verge of collapse
In the Marina District residents spent yesterday assessing damage cleaning up and trying to find friends and neighbors
Evelyn Boccone 85 years old has lived in the district most of her life
Her parents lost everything in the 1906 earthquake
Now we realize what our mothers must have gone through she says
We always heard about the earthquake but as children we did n't always listen

G.D. Searle & Co. a Monsanto Co. unit is launching a program to give consumers more information about its drugs when doctors prescribe them
Called Patients in the Know the program features fact sheets designed to be easy to understand
The sheets tell how the medicine works describe how to use it and list its possible side effects
They are designed to be given to patients by their doctors when the medicines are prescribed and include space for the doctor to write special instructions
In addition Searle will give pharmacists brochures on the use of prescription drugs for distribution in their stores
Consumer groups have long advocated that drug companies and doctors make more information available to patients
We believe that every drug that 's marketed to a consumer should have a consumer label said Douglas Teich of the Public Citizen Health Research Group a Ralph Nader affiliate
Dr. Teich said Searle is the only company I know that voluntarily will make consumer information available
According to federal officials and drug-industry studies nearly half of the 1.6 billion prescriptions filled each year are n't used properly meaning that money is wasted on some prescriptions and patients are deprived of the benefits of medication
We think it 's very important to provide as much information as possible on the drugs consumers take said Searle Chairman Sheldon Gilgore
Bond prices rambled yesterday as investors kept close watch on the stock market and worried about a wave of new supply
Early yesterday bonds rose as investors rushed to buy Treasury securities on the prospect that stocks would plummet in the aftermath of the massive California earthquake
For example some securities analysts warned that stocks of certain insurance companies which face massive damage claims would get hit hard
But when the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose instead bonds drifted lower
With stocks not a major focus we 're waiting for the next guiding light said Brian J. Fabbri chief economist at Midland Montagu Securities Inc
If the stock market tremors are behind us then the bond market will go back to looking at the next batch of economic numbers to determine where interest rates are heading
The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond which jumped 3\/8 point or about 3.75 for each 1,000 face amount during the first hour of trading ended little changed
Interest rates barely budged from Tuesday 's levels
Most junk bonds which have been battered in recent weeks continued a slow recuperation and ended unchanged to slightly higher
But some so-called high-quality junk issues fell as some mutual funds sold their most liquid issues to raise cash
RJR Holdings Capital Corp. 's 14.7 % bonds due 2009 fell one point
Other RJR issues fell between 1\/2 point and 1 1\/2 point
In the latest sign of how difficult it is to place certain junk bonds Continental Airlines said it was forced to scale back the size of its latest offering
Continental a unit of Texas Air Corp. slashed the size of its note offering from 150 million to 71 million
The move had been widely expected
In the multipart offering the company sold a portion of secured notes but shelved all the unsecured notes
A Continental spokeswoman said the notes may be offered at a later date
This was not a do-or-die deal she said
I think this is a market that required some level of security
It did not make sense to offer unsecured paper in an unsettling market
Investors have been speculating for weeks about the market 's ability to place the 7 billion to 10 billion of new junk bonds scheduled to be sold by year end
Supply troubles were also on the minds of Treasury investors yesterday who worried about the flood of new government securities coming next week
We 're being bombarded by new Treasury and agency debt offerings said William Sullivan Jr. director of money-market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc
The market is concerned about its ability to underwrite all this debt at current levels
In addition to the 15.6 billion of Treasury bills to be sold at next week 's regular Monday auction the government will sell 10 billion of new two-year Treasury notes
And Resolution Funding Corp. said late yesterday that it will sell 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds Wednesday
Refcorp is the financing unit of Resolution Trust Corp. a new government agency created to rescue the nation 's troubled thrifts
Its securities have been dubbed bailout bonds by traders
In when-issued trading the two-year Treasurys had a yield of about 7.88 %
In the municipal market all eyes were on California debt as investors tried to gauge the financial ramifications of Tuesday 's earthquake
But traders said the quake had only a minor impact on the trading of California state and local municipal debt
There are certain bonds traders refer to as earthquake bonds because the issuers are on top of the San Andreas fault said Zane Mann editor of the California Municipal Bond Advisor a newsletter for investors
Since those bonds already pay a slightly higher yield an extra premium for the earthquake risk they were n't materially affected
But some bond market analysts said that could quickly change if property casualty insurance companies scramble to sell portions of their municipal portfolios to raise cash to pay damage claims
Insurance companies will foot a substantial amount of the bill to reconstruct San Francisco said Charles Lieberman chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp
He also expects the performance of municipals to lag Treasurys as California is forced to issue new debt over time to repair public facilities
A report issued late yesterday by Standard & Poor 's Corp. concluded the quake wo n't cause wide-scale credit deterioration for issuers and debt issues in the 12-county area of Northern California affected by the quake
Treasury Securities Treasury bonds ended narrowly mixed in quiet trading
The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 100 29\/32 to yield 8.03 % compared with 100 28\/32 to yield 8.04 % Tuesday
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at a price of 99 26\/32 to yield 8 % compared with 99 25\/32 to yield 8.01 %
Short-term rates were little changed
Corporate Issues Investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1\/4 point lower
The Continental junk bond offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. was the only new issue priced yesterday
In the four-part offering the 71 million of secured equipment certificates was priced to yield 13.75 % to 15.75 %
Municipals Municipal bonds ended about 1\/8 to 3\/8 point lower hurt by the circulation of two bid-wanted lists totaling 655 million
Chemical Securities Inc. is acting as agent for the seller
Meanwhile some California issues were down a touch more than the broad market but traders said there had n't been much investor selling because of the quake
But New York City general obligation bonds came under selling pressure
Traders said a steady stream of bonds was put up for sale yesterday pushing yields for longer maturities up 0.05 percentage point
Traders said investors were reacting to recent negative news on the city 's finances and are nervous ahead of the Nov. 7 election
Washington D.C. topped the competitive slate yesterday with a sale of 200 million of general obligation tax revenue anticipation notes
In late trading New Jersey Turnpike Authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 was off 1\/4 point at 98 bid
The yield was 7.35 % up 0.01 percentage point
Mortgage-Backed Securities Mortgage securities ended little changed after light dealings
There was no appreciable market impact from the California earthquake
Dealers said there was some concern that insurance companies might be forced to sell mortgage securities to help pay earthquake-related claims but no selling materialized
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National Mortgage Association two dominant issuers of mortgage securities have a sizable amount of California home loans in their mortgagebacked pools
But their potential quake exposure is seen as small given that they require a financial cushion on all the loans they purchase
And because Northern California home prices are so high loans from the region often are too large to be included in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae pools
Meanwhile Government National Mortgage Association 9 % securities for November delivery ended at 97 29\/32 unchanged
Freddie Mac 9 % securities were at 97 4\/32 down 1\/32
In derivative markets Fannie Mae issued two 400 million real estate mortgage investment conduits backed by its 9 % securities
Foreign Bonds British government bonds or gilts ended moderately lower as equities there recovered from Tuesday 's drop
The Treasury 's 11 3\/4 % bond due 2003\/2007 fell 11\/32 to 111 31\/32 to yield 10.08 % while the 12 % notes due 1995 were down 7\/32 to 103 22\/32 to yield 11.04 %
Traders said today may be an anxious day for the market
Several key economic figures are due out and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson is scheduled to give the annual Mansion House address to the financial community
The chancellor sometimes has used the occasion to announce major economic policy changes
Economists do n't expect any such changes in this year 's address given Mr. Lawson 's apparent reluctance to adjust policy currently
Meanwhile Japanese government bonds retreated in quiet trading stymied by the dollar 's resiliency
Japan 's bellwether 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended on brokers ' screens at 95.75 to yield 5.315 %
In West Germany investors stayed on the sidelines as the bond market searched for direction
The government 's 7 % issue due October 1999 fell 0.05 point to 99.90 to yield 7.01 %
The Berlin Wall still stands
But the man who built it has fallen
East Germany yesterday removed Erich Honecker one of the staunchest holdouts against the reform rumbling through the Communist world in an effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly rebellious citizens
But while it was a move that stunned the East bloc it hardly ushers in an era of reform at least anytime soon
For the Politburo replaced Mr. Honecker who had led East Germany for 18 years and before that headed its security apparatus with a man cut of the same cloth Egon Krenz the most recent internal-security chief and a longtime Honecker protege
East Germany it is clear is no Poland where the Communist Party now shares power with the democratically elected Solidarity union
Nor is it a Hungary where yesterday the parliament approved constitutional changes meant to help turn the Communist nation into a multiparty democracy
Still any change in East Germany has enormous implications for both East and West
It raises the long-cherished hopes of many Germans for reunification a prospect that almost equally alarms political leaders in Moscow Washington and Western Europe
Mr. Krenz 52 was named the new party chief just minutes after the Party 's 163-member Central Committee convened in East Berlin
Although the East German news agency ADN claimed Mr. Honecker had asked to be relieved of his duties for health reasons West German government sources said the 26-man Politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late Tuesday
Mr. Honecker was twice hospitalized this summer for a gall bladder ailment and his physical condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the Western media
ADN said Mr. Honecker a hard-line Stalinist who in 1961 supervised the construction of the Berlin Wall also was relieved of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military
Mr. Krenz is expected to be formally named to all three positions once the nation 's parliament convenes later this week
Mr. Honecker 's ignoble fall culminates nearly two decades of iron-handed leadership during which Mr. Honecker now 77 years old built East Germany into the most economically advanced nation in the Soviet bloc
His grip on power unraveled this summer as thousands of his countrymen dissatisfied by the harshness of his rule fled to the West
Thousands more have taken to the streets in the last month in East Germany 's largest wave of domestic unrest since a workers ' uprising in 1953
In Washington the Bush administration took a characteristically cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change
The official line was to offer warmer ties to Mr. Krenz provided he is willing to institute reforms
But U.S. officials have strong doubts that he is a reformer
President Bush told reporters Whether that the leadership change reflects a change in East-West relations I do n't think so
Because Mr. Krenz has been very much in accord with the policies of Honecker
One top U.S. expert on East Germany added There is no clear-cut champion of reform that we know of in the East German leadership
Indeed Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups
He said while dialogue is important enough forums already exist in which different interests can express themselves
The removal of Mr. Honecker was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the Communist party
According to West German government sources Mr. Honecker and several senior Politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change
But with public demonstrations in the country growing in size and intensity Mr. Honecker and several key allies lost out in this battle officials say
Those allies included Politburo members Guenter Mittag who has long headed economic affairs and Joachim Hermann chief of information policy
Both men were also relieved of their duties yesterday
Although other resignations may follow it 's still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government 's resistance to fundamental change
Clearly the central figure in this process is Egon Krenz
Born in 1937 in a Baltic Sea town now part of Poland he was eight years old when World War II ended
Like West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during Germany 's division
Since joining the Politburo in 1983 as its youngest member Mr. Krenz had acquired the nickname crown prince a reference to the widely held view that he was the hand-picked successor to Mr. Honecker
In fact the two men have had strikingly similar career paths both having served as chief of internal security before their rise to the top party position
Moreover both men have hewn to a similar hard-line philosophy
Notably one of Mr. Krenz 's few official visits overseas came a few months ago when he visited China after the massacre in Beijing
He later defended the Chinese government 's response during a separate visit to West Germany
East German Protestantism in particular fears Mr. Krenz in part because of an incident in January 1988 when he was believed to have ordered the arrest of hundreds of dissidents who had sought refuge in the Church
However Mr. Krenz also has a reputation for being politically savvy
His shrewd ability to read the shifting popular mood in East Germany is best illustrated by his apparent break with his old mentor Mr. Honecker
Indeed according to West German government sources he was one of the leaders in the power struggle that toppled Mr. Honecker
In recent days Mr. Krenz has sought to project a kinder image
According to a report widely circulating in East Berlin it was Mr. Krenz who ordered police to stop using excessive force against demonstrators in Leipzig
He does n't want to have the image of the gun man says Fred Oldenburg an expert at the Bonn-sponsored Institute of East European and International Studies in Cologne
He 's not a reformer he wants to have the image of a reformer
As part of his image polishing Mr. Krenz is expected to take modest steps toward reform to rebuild confidence among the people and reassert the party 's authority
Besides sacking other senior Politburo officials who allied themselves with Mr. Honecker Mr. Krenz could loosen controls on the news media free up travel restrictions and establish a dialogue with various dissident groups
But will it be enough West German government officials and Western analysts are doubtful
He does n't signify what people want so the unrest will go on Mr. Oldenburg predicts
At the same time the expectations of the East German people are great and will continue to grow
Says one West German official What 's necessary now is the process of democratization
Not just that people are being heard but that their interests are being taken seriously
Chancellor Kohl meanwhile has invited Mr. Krenz to open discussions with Bonn on a wide range of subjects
Reports in the West German press citing sources in East Germany suggest Mr. Krenz may serve only as a bridge between Mr. Honecker and a genuine reform leader
Adding to that speculation is Mr. Krenz 's reputation as a heavy drinker who is said to also suffer from diabetes
This is a dynamic process and we 're experiencing the first step the Bonn official adds
The selection of Mr. Krenz may also disappoint Moscow
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has pressed hard for a change in East Germany 's rigid stance
Two reform-minded party leaders favored by Moscow as possible successors to Mr. Honecker Dresden party secretary Hans Modrow and Politburo member Guenter Schabowski were passed over
If Mr. Krenz sticks to rigid policies the pressure from the Soviet Union could intensify
In Moscow Mr. Gorbachev sent Mr. Krenz a congratulatory telegram that appeared to urge the new leadership to heed growing calls for change
According to the Soviet news agency Tass Gorbachev expressed the conviction that the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of East Germany being sensitive to the demands of the time will find solutions to complicated problems the GDR German Democratic Republic encountered
A force of younger pro-Gorbachev members in the East German bureaucracy has for some time been pushing for relaxation within their country
The older generation has been torn between a fear of tampering with the status quo and a fear of what might happen if they did n't
From the perspective of East Germany 's old guard reforms that smack of capitalism and Western-style democracy could eliminate their country 's reason for being
Unlike the other nations of the bloc East Germany is a creature of the Cold War
Erasing the differences still dividing Europe and the vast international reordering that implies wo n't endanger the statehood of a Poland or a Hungary
But it could ultimately lead to German reunification and the disappearance of East Germany from the map
Which is what the Old Guard fears
I 'm sure they 'll formulate a reform that will be a recipe for the GDR 's future as a separately identifiable state says Michael Simmons a British journalist whose book on East Germany entitled The Unloved Country was published this month
Up to now that recipe has consisted of a dogged effort by former leader Walter Ulbricht to establish the country 's international legitimacy followed by Mr. Honecker 's campaign to build the East bloc 's only successful Stalinist economy into a consumer paradise
Neither man achieved perfection
Early in 1987 Mr. Honecker and his team stopped paying thin compliments to Mr. Gorbachev and joined with Romania in rejecting any necessity for adjustments in their systems
The less-self-confident Czechoslovaks and Bulgarians in contrast declared their intentions to reform while doing nothing concrete about it
The East German media soon began presenting Mr. Gorbachev 's speeches only as sketchy summaries and giving space to his opponents
By late 1988 they were banning Soviet publications
The country abandoned its former devotion to socialist unity and took to insisting instead that each country in the bloc ought to travel its own road
Mr. Honecker spoke of generally valid objective laws of socialism and left no room for debate
With this year 's dislocations in China and the Soviet Union and the drive to democracy in Poland and Hungary the East German leadership grew still more defensive
Politburo member Joachim Herrman confessed to a grave concern over Hungarian democracy
Under the banner that proclaims the renewal of socialism he said forces are at work that are striving to eliminate socialism
Some loyal voices in and out of the East German Communist party saw the nation 's unrest coming
The first signs were economic
Despite heavily subsidized consumer industries East Germans have for years watched the West pull farther out ahead
In 1988 for the first time economic growth came to a dead stop
Gingerly some economists began to blame central planning
Some writers in theoretical journals even raised the notion of introducing democracy at least in the workplace
By summer an independent reform movement was saying out loud what it had only whispered before
But they are stalwart socialists
Their proclaimed purpose is to cleanse East Germany of its Stalinist muck not to merge with the West
One of their pastors has envisioned a new utopia of creative socialism
Meanwhile the man Mr. Krenz replaces has left an indelible mark on East German society
Imprisoned by the Nazis during World War II for his political beliefs Mr. Honecker typified the postwar generation of committed Communist leaders in Eastern Europe who took their cues from Moscow
He was a socialist warrior who felt rankled by West Germany 's enormous postwar prosperity and the Bonn government 's steadfast refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his state
Finally during his first and only state visit to Bonn two years ago he won some measure of the recognition he had long sought
But ultimately he was undone by forces unleashed by his own comrade Mr. Gorbachev
Mr. Honecker 's removal was bound to happen says one aide to Chancellor Kohl
It was only a matter of time
The European Community Commission increased its forecast for economic growth in the EC in 1989 to 3.5 % slightly higher than its June projection of 3.25 %
In its annual economic report for 1989-1990 the commission also projected 1990 gross domestic product growth for the 12 EC members at 3 %
EC inflation was seen at 4.8 % in 1989 higher than 1988 's 3.6 % price rise
However inflation for 1990 was seen slowing to 4.5 %
Leading EC growth forecasts in 1989 was Ireland seen growing 5 % at constant prices
Slower growth countries included Greece at 2.5 % the U.K. at 2.25 % and Denmark at 1.75 %
Inflation is expected to be highest in Greece where it is projected at 14.25 % and Portugal at 13 %
At the other end of the spectrum West German inflation was forecast at 3 % in 1989 and 2.75 % in 1990
Nestle Korea Ltd. opened a coffee and non-dairy-creamer plant in Chongju South Korea
An official at Nestle Korea a 50-50 joint venture between Nestle S.A. and the Doosan Group said the new facility will manufacture all types of soluble roasted and ground coffee coffee mix and nondairy coffee creamer
The South Korean coffee market consisting mostly of instant coffee was estimated at about 100 billion won 150.7 million last year
Brands made by the Kraft General Foods unit of Philip Morris Cos. had about 95 % of the market share
Nestle currently has only about a 2 % share with its Taster 's Choice coffee

The chairman and a director of one of the Republic of Singapore 's leading property companies City Development Ltd. or CDL were charged yesterday with criminal breach of trust of some 800,000 Singapore dollars about 409,000
Kwek Hong Png chairman of CDL and director Quek Leng Chye were arrested by the republic 's Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau Tuesday night
In addition to abetting in the alleged criminal breach of trust Kwek Hong Png was also charged with dishonestly receiving 500,000 that had been stolen
Both men were charged in a subordinate court and released on bail of 1 million
The charges are the culmination of weeks of rumors concerning CDL that have depressed the company 's share price and to a lesser extent the shares of all companies owned by CDL 's controlling Quek family brokers in Singapore say
The Queks control the Hong Leong Group which has widespread interests in manufacturing property and finance in both Malaysia and Singapore
News of the arrest and charging of the two men helped to push prices on the Singapore Stock market sharply lower in early trading yesterday but brokers said that the market and CDL shares recovered once it became apparent the charges were limited to the two men personally

As the citizens of San Francisco and surrounding communities began assessing the damage from Tuesday 's devastating earthquake NBC News began assessing the damage from what some said was a failure to provide comprehensive coverage in the earthquake 's initial moments
In terms of coverage it was a disaster equal to the earthquakes said Eric Premner president for broadcasting of King Broadcasting Co. which owns the NBC affiliate in Seattle Wash
While rival ABC News outstripped the competition in live coverage of the event by sheer luck the network was broadcasting the World Series from Candlestick Park when the quake struck NBC News was unable to get its signal out of San Francisco for the first hour after the quake
I have to attribute the lackluster performance to a natural disaster said Mr. Premner
So before I start to be really critical of NBC I would like to know more about what happened
There were no complaints from affiliates of CBS Inc. and Cable News Network a unit of Turner Broadcasting System Inc
But that was not the case at NBC News which has been dogged with the image of not being aggressive on major breaking stories
Last summer the affiliates bitterly complained to network executives about the poor coverage of the student uprising in China
I was not pleased with the slow start and neither was NBC News said Guy Hempel general manager of NBC affiliate WAVE in Louisville Ky
A spokesman for National Broadcasting Co. a unit of General Electric Co. said the network was looking into what happened
The stations said they were pleased with the extended coverage yesterday including a special five-hour edition of Today
Don Browne director of news at NBC News said in an interview that we could n't get a signal out of San Francisco
We were out of the box
It was horrible
The comment we 're hearing is that we were slow out of the box but beat everyone else in the stretch
NBC broadcast throughout the entire night and did not go off the air until noon yesterday
The quake postponed the third and fourth games of the World Series
In place of the games ABC said it planned to broadcast next week 's episodes of its prime-time Wednesday and Thursday lineups except for a one-hour special on the earthquake at 10 p.m. last night
The series is scheduled to resume Tuesday evening in San Francisco
There are no commercials to make up for since we 're going to eventually broadcast the World Series said a network spokesman
Pinnacle West Capital Corp. said it suspended indefinitely its common stock dividend and reported a 91 % plunge in third-quarter net income
The announcement made after the close of trading caught analysts by surprise
The company closed at 12 a share down 62.5 cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Pinnacle West slashed its quarterly dividend to 40 cents per share from 70 cents in December saying at the time that it believed the new lower dividend was sustainable
A company spokesman said the decision to eliminate the dividend resulted from a quarterly appraisal and that circumstances had changed since the December announcement
He declined to elaborate
Edward J. Tirello Jr. an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. speculated that the sudden dividend elimination presages an expensive agreement with thrift regulators over the company 's insolvent MeraBank savings and loan unit
Analysts have estimated that Pinnacle West may have to inject between 300 million and 400 million into the MeraBank unit before turning the thrift over to federal regulators
The latest financial results at the troubled utility and thrift holding company based in Phoenix Ariz. reflect continuing problems at MeraBank and losses in real-estate venture-capital and uranium-mining operations
Third-quarter net income slid to 5.1 million or six cents a share from 56 million or 65 cents a year earlier
Utility operations the only company unit operating in the black in the latest period had a 26 % drop in profit to 86.3 million largely as a result of outages at the company 's huge Palo Verde nuclear facility and the cost of purchased replacement power
In other operations losses at MeraBank totaled 85.7 million in the latest quarter compared with a 2.5 million profit a year earlier
The latest quarter includes a 42.7 million addition to loan-loss reserves
As recently as August the company said it did n't foresee a need for substantial additions to reserves
Pinnacle 's SunCor Development Co
real-estate unit 's loss narrowed to 13.8 million from 78.4 million
The latest period included a 9 million write-down on undeveloped land while the year-earlier period included a 46 million reserve for real-estate losses
Losses at its Malapai Resources Co
uranium-mining unit narrowed to 3.4 million from 18 million a year ago which included a 9 million write-down of utility inventories
Losses at El Dorado Investment Co. the venture-capital operation widened to 6.8 million from 425,000 a year earlier
The latest quarter included a 6.6 million write-down of investments
Equitec Financial Group said it will ask as many as 100,000 investors in 12 of its public real-estate limited partnerships to give approval to rolling them up into a new master limited partnership
Under the proposal by Equitec a financially troubled real-estate syndicator New York-based Hallwood Group Inc. would replace Equitec as the newly formed master limited partnership 's general partner and manager
Shares of the new partnership would trade on an exchange like a stock
Hallwood is a merchant bank whose activities include the ownership management and financial restructuring of shopping centers office buildings apartments and other real estate
In a statement Equitec Chairman Richard L. Saalfeld said the transfer will benefit both the company and investors in the 12 limited partnerships included in the proposed rollup
While he did n't describe the partnerships ' financial condition he said their operations continue to drain the resources of Equitec
Equitec posted a 3.3 million net loss in the second quarter on 11.8 million of revenue compared with a net loss of 12.9 million in the year-earlier period on revenue of 9.1 million
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Equitec closed at 2.625 a share unchanged
Because of Tuesday 's earthquake in Northern California company officials could n't immediately be reached for additional comment
A spokesman for Hallwood said the 12 limited partnerships which were marketed by brokerage firms and financial planners between 1979 and 1984 raised several hundred million dollars from investors
With airline deals in a tailspin legendary Wall Street trader Michael Steinhardt could have trouble parachuting out of USAir Group traders say
Only a week ago when airline buy-out fever was already winding down Mr. Steinhardt was engaged in a duel with USAir
He was threatening to take over the carrier after spending an estimated 167 million to build an 8.4 % USAir stake for his investment clients
The would-be raider even hired an investment banker to give teeth to his takeover threat which was widely interpreted as an effort to flush out an acquirer for USAir or for his own stake
In fighting USAir Mr. Steinhardt was pitted against another investor billionnaire Warren Buffett who bought into USAir to help fend off Mr. Steinhardt
Mr. Buffett 's firm Berkshire Hathaway holds a much bigger stake in the carrier than Mr. Steinhardt 's firm Steinhardt Partners
Now in the wake of UAL 's troubles in financing its buy-out the airline raiding game has been grounded
Instead of hoping to sell his USAir stake at analysts ' estimated buy-out price of 80 a share Mr. Steinhardt is stuck with roughly 3.7 million USAir shares that cost him 45 on average but yesterday closed at 40 1\/2 up 1\/4 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
It does n't make sense to parachute out at this price Mr. Steinhardt says though he has stopped his takeover talk and now commends USAir managers ' operating skills
At the current price the USAir holding represents 9 % of all the assets that Mr. Steinhardt manages
A week ago USAir stock briefly soared above 52 after a report in USA Today that Mr. Steinhardt might launch a hostile bid for the carrier though takeover speculators say they were skeptical
If USAir is worth 80 as a takeover and the stock went to 52 the market was saying Steinhardt 's presence was n't worth anything in terms of getting a deal done says a veteran takeover speculator
Traders say this all goes to show that even the smartest money manager can get infected with crowd passions
In trying to raid USAir Mr. Steinhardt abandoned his usual role as a passive investor and ran into snags
Moreover unlike Mr. Buffett who often holds big stakes in companies for years Mr. Steinhardt has n't in the past done much long-term investing
Mr. Steinhardt who runs about 1.7 billion for Steinhardt Partners made his name as a gunslinging trader moving in and out of stocks with agility enriching himself and his investment clients
Meanwhile his big losses for instance in 1987 's crash generally have been trading losses
So some see a special irony in the fact that Mr. Steinhardt the trader now is encumbered with a massive illiquid airline holding
Analysts say USAir stock might lose four or five points if the Steinhardt stake was dumped all at once
As a result Mr. Steinhardt must reconcile himself to selling USAir at a loss or to holding the shares as an old-fashioned investment
Long-term investing that 's not Steinhardt 's style chuckles an investor who once worked at Steinhardt Partners
He does n't usually risk that much unless he thinks he has an ace in the hole adds another Steinhardt Partners alumnus
In recent days traders say USAir has been buying its own shares as part of a program to retire about eight million USAir shares though the carrier wo n't discuss its buy-back program
If USAir stepped up its share purchases that might be a way for Mr. Steinhardt to get out says Timothy Pettee a Merrill Lynch analyst
But USAir might not want to help Mr. Steinhardt he adds
In 1987 USAir Chairman Edwin Colodny stonewalled when Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl Icahn threatened to take over the carrier
Mr. Icahn a much more practiced raider than Mr. Steinhardt eventually sold a big USAir stake at a tiny profit through Bear Stearns
Mr. Steinhardt also could take that route
He confers big trading commissions on Wall Street firms
However with airline stocks cratering he might not get a very good price for his shares traders say
Especially galling for Mr. Steinhardt say people close to him is that USAir 's Mr. Colodny wo n't even take his telephone calls
While USAir is n't considered absolutely takeover-proof its defenses including the sale in August of a 12 % stake in the company to Mr. Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway are pretty strong
USAir 's deal with Mr. Buffett was n't exactly a shining example of shareholder democracy Mr. Steinhardt says
Since last April the investor has made seven so-called 13D filings in USAir as he bought and sold the company 's stock
Such disclosures of big holdings often are used by raiders to try to scare a company 's managers and to stir interest in the stock
But of course it would be highly unusual for an investment fund such as Steinhardt Partners to take over a company
USAir and Mr. Buffett wo n't talk about Mr. Steinhardt at all
Analysts say USAir has great promise
By the second half of 1990 USAir stock could hit 60 says Helane Becker of Shearson Lehman Hutton
She thinks traders should buy the stock if it tumbles to 35
But meanwhile USAir is expected to show losses or lackluster profit for several quarters as it tries to digest Piedmont Airlines which it acquired
Moreover some investors think a recession or renewed airfare wars will pummel airline stocks in coming months
However Mr. Steinhardt says he 's comfortable holding USAir as an investment
While he has bought and sold some USAir shares in recent days he says that contrary to rumors he has n't tried to unload his holding
Mr. Steinhardt adds that he bought USAir stock earlier this year as part of a fundamental investment in the airline group
In 1989 Mr. Steinhardt says he made money trading in Texas Air AMR and UAL
Overall his investments so far this year are showing gains of about 20 % he adds
Does Mr. Steinhardt regret his incursion into the takeover-threat game People close to the investor say that was an experiment he is unlikely to repeat
I do n't think you 'll find I 'm making a radical change in my traditional investment style Mr. Steinhardt says
Addington Resources Inc. said it called for redemption on Nov. 21 its 25.8 million outstanding of 8 % convertible subordinated debentures due 2013
The debentures were issued in the face amount of 46 million on July 11 1988 the Ashland Ky. coal mining water transportation and construction company said
The company said the redemption is permitted because the price of Addington 's stock has equaled or exceeded 19.60 for 20 consecutive trading days a condition set in the terms of the debentures
Debenture holders are expected to convert most of the debentures into common because the value of the stock received in a conversion would exceed the 1,103.11 redemption price
Commodore International Ltd. said it will report a loss for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 because sales of personal computers for the home market remained weak in some major countries
That will mark the second consecutive quarterly loss for Commodore and will raise additional questions about whether it can sustain the turnaround it had seemed to be engineering
Commodore West Chester Pa. had said in August that it was consolidating manufacturing to cut costs and expected to be profitable in the fiscal first quarter
Commodore said that its announcement is based on preliminary information and that the situation could look different by the time final results are announced early next month
In fact Commodore 's fiscal fourth-quarter loss was 2 million narrower than Commodore had expected a few weeks after the quarter closed
Still even results approaching break-even would mark a sharp weakening compared with fiscal 1989 first-quarter earnings of 9.6 million or 30 cents a share on sales of 200.2 million
Reflecting concerns about Commodore 's outlook its stock has plunged more than 50 % since May closing yesterday unchanged at 8.875 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
The price can be expected to erode further because the loss estimate came after the market closed
Commodore has seemed to be setting the stage recently for progress in the U.S. where its personal-computer sales have been so dismal for years that Commodore is close to dropping off research firms ' market-share charts
Commodore has assembled an experienced management team it has persuaded many more dealers to carry its products and it has unleashed a slick advertising campaign
But those represent long-term strategies that probably wo n't succeed quickly even if they turn out to be the right ones
In the meantime the strategies will increase expenses
Commodore had been counting on its consumer business to stay sufficiently healthy to support its efforts in other areas mainly in getting schools and businesses to use its Amiga which has slick graphics yet has been slow to catch on because it is n't compatible with Apple Computer Inc. or International Business Machines Corp. hardware
But sales to consumers have become difficult during the past several months even in West Germany which has been by far Commodore 's strongest market
The Commodore 64 and 128 mainly used for children 's educational software and games had surprised market researchers by continuing to produce strong sales even though other low-profit personal computers now operate several times as fast and have much more memory
Commodore has said it expects sales to rebound but market researchers have said that sales of the low-end products may finally be trailing off
Stock prices closed slightly higher in the first routine trading day since Friday 's big plunge

In addition activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the Bay area
Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying
The early move essentially established the day 's trading range and traders said they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently
I did n't expect it to be this quiet
I expected to see more volatility as some of the institutions who were spooked last Friday did some selling said Raymond F. DeVoe a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Baltimore
Mr. DeVoe said he expects prices to show some renewed instability over the next few sessions as institutions re-evaluate their stance toward the market in light of its decline
I would suspect that a lot of investment committees are looking into whether they want to be in stocks at all he said
Insurance stocks were sold at the opening amid concerns about the level of damage claims the companies would receive as a result of the earthquake

Computer Associates International Inc. Garden City N.Y. and Digital Equipment Corp. said they agreed to jointly develop software to help manage Digital 's Vax computers
Computer Associates has carved out a huge business selling such software for use in managing networks of International Business Machines Corp. computers but needs to find new markets if it is to maintain its growth rate of 30 % and more each year
The market for system-management software for Digital 's hardware is fragmented enough that a giant such as Computer Associates should do well there
At the same time the market is smaller than the market for IBM-compatible software
For one thing Digital Maynard Mass. has sold fewer machines
In addition its machines are typically easier to operate so customers require less assistance from software

Hoses and plastics together account for about 42 % of Trinova 's total annual sales
In a separate announcement Trinova said the Aeroquip group has agreed to sell its spring-brake piston-brake and related businesses to Midland Brake Inc. of Branford Conn
Terms were n't disclosed
To provide for the restructuring 's costs Trinova said it took an after-tax charge of 38.5 million or 1.13 a share in the third quarter

A group of investors including Giancarlo Parretti 's Pathe Communications Corp. and Sasea Holding S.A. have agreed to buy 76.66 % of Odeon Finanziaria a financially troubled Italian TV station
Florio Fiorini managing director of Geneva-based Sasea said the investors would pay only a symbolic one lira for the station but we have agreed to raise the capital that will enable the company to continue operating
It 's sort of a Chapter 11 situation he added referring to the U.S. bankruptcy law that protects companies from creditors while they restructure
Milan-based Odeon which draws about 3 % of Italian TV viewers has debt of 250 billion lire 181.9 million Mr. Fiorini said
He added that details of the recapitalization still have to be worked out but that Pathe will take 50 % of Odeon Rome film producer Bruno Lucisano will take 10 % and the remaining 16.66 % currently owned by Sasea will eventually be sold to other investors
Calisto Tanzi Odeon 's owner will retain his 23.34 % stake
Italy 's Supreme Court this year ordered Parliament to write a law that will regulate media ownership
We think that it 's going to be far more favorable to own a station before the law is passed than to try to buy one afterward Mr. Fiorini said
San Francisco area officials gave the media high marks for helping people find shelter and obtain emergency information after Tuesday 's catastrophic earthquake
The press has been doing an excellent job

Mr. Ball noted that television stations featured people holding up phone books explaining where to call for help
Radio stations provided an emergency number for people who smelled gas but did n't know how to turn off their gas supply
Kim Schwartz a spokesperson for the American Red Cross in Los Angeles said television and radio stations in San Francisco played a very positive role by providing the address of 28 shelters of the Red Cross and by giving out the Red Cross number for contributions to help earthquake victims 1-800-453-9000

Sterling which estimated the value of the contract at 150 million said NASA selected another bidder for final negotiations
In 1988 Dallas-based Sterling protested a similar decision by NASA involving the same contract claiming it had submitted the lowest bid
As a result last March the General Services Administration board of contract appeals directed NASA to reopen negotiations on the contract
Sterling said it had requested a briefing by NASA but had not decided whether to protest the agency 's latest decision

Sales declined 10 % to 251.2 million from 278.7 million
The Atlanta-based chemical manufacturer said lower prices hurt margins for most products
We did see some relief in raw material costs but it was n't sufficient to offset the drop in sales prices James R. Kuse the company 's chairman and chief executive officer said in a statement
On a per-share basis quarterly earnings remained at 1.85 the same as last year because of the company 's share buy-back program
Georgia Gulf had 24.9 million shares outstanding on average in the quarter compared with 28.6 million in the third quarter of 1988 adjusted for a stock split paid in January 1989
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading stock in Georgia Gulf which has been mentioned as a takeover candidate rose 2.125 a share to close at 46.125

Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley used the opportunity to push the City Council harder to pass a measure establishing a loss-recovery reserve of 100 million
The amount would help Los Angeles cope in the first few weeks after its own anticipated quake while waiting for federal assistance to arrive
After San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos spoke on television of the need for building inspectors to check the soundness of buildings Los Angeles dispatched 32 inspectors to help
And the county of Los Angeles placed its firefighters and sheriffs on alert ready to send in reinforcements and alerted San Francisco that the city has 1,000 hospital beds at its disposal
Two Los Angeles radio stations initiated Red Cross donation campaigns and one Los Angeles bank manager forked over 150,000 of his own money for relief purposes the Red Cross said

Great American Bank citing depressed Arizona real estate prices posted a third-quarter loss of 59.4 million or 2.48 a share
A year earlier the savings bank had earnings of 8.1 million or 33 cents a share
For the nine months it had a loss of 58.3 million or 2.44 a share after earnings of 29.5 million or 1.20 a share in the 1988 period
Great American said it increased its loan-loss reserves by 93 million after reviewing its loan portfolio raising its total loan and real estate reserves to 217 million
Before the loan-loss addition it said it had operating profit of 10 million for the quarter
The move followed a round of similar increases by other lenders against Arizona real estate loans reflecting a continuing decline in that market
In addition to the increased reserve the savings bank took a special charge of 5 million representing general and administrative expenses from staff reductions and other matters and it posted a 7.6 million reduction in expected mortgage servicing fees reflecting the fact that more borrowers are prepaying their mortgages
Arbitragers were n't the only big losers in the collapse of UAL Corp. stock
Look at what happened to UAL 's chairman Stephen M. Wolf and its chief financial officer John C. Pope
On a day some United Airlines employees wanted Mr. Wolf fired and takeover stock speculators wanted his scalp Messrs. Wolf and Pope saw their prospective personal fortunes continue to plummet as shares of UAL United 's parent company dived 24.875 on the Big Board to close at 198
Including Monday 's plunge that has given the two executives paper losses of 49.5 million based on what they would have realized had the pilots and management-led buy-out of UAL gone through at 300 a share
When bank financing for the buy-out collapsed last week so did UAL 's stock
Even if the banks resurrect a financing package at 250 a share the two executives would still get about 25 million less than they stood to gain in the initial transaction
Mr. Wolf owns 75,000 UAL shares and has options to buy another 250,000 at 83.3125 each
In the 300-a-share buyout that totaled about 76.7 million
By yesterday 's close of trading it was good for a paltry 43.5 million
Of course Mr. Wolf 48 years old has some savings
He left his last two jobs at Republic Airlines and Flying Tiger with combined stock-option gains of about 22 million and UAL gave him a 15 million bonus when it hired him
His 1988 salary was 575,000 with a 575,000 bonus
The 40-year old Mr. Pope has n't changed jobs enough at least the right ones to stash away that kind of money
United paid him a 375,000 bonus to lure him away from American Airlines and he was paid a salary of 342,122 last year with a 280,000 bonus
Mr. Pope owns 10,000 UAL shares and has options to buy another 150,000 at 69 each
That came to a combined 37.7 million under the 300-a-share buy-out but just 21.3 million at yesterday 's close
Of the combined 114.4 million the two men were scheduled to reap under the buy-out they agreed to invest in the buy-out just 15 million angering many of the thousands of workers asked to make pay concessions so the buy-out would be a success
United 's directors voted themselves and their spouses lifetime access to the Friendly Skies free first-class travel and 20,000 a year for life as well
Conceivably in a scaled-back buy-out they could be bumped back to coach seats for life
Thomas H. Johnson president of the Coatedboard division of Mead Corp. was named president of Manville Forest Products Corp. a Manville unit and senior vice president of Manville Corp
Mr. Johnson succeeds Harry W. Sherman who resigned to pursue other interests in both positions
Manville is a building and forest products concern
US Facilities Corp. said Robert J. Percival agreed to step down as vice chairman of the insurance holding company
There was a difference of opinion as to the future direction of the company a spokeswoman said
Mr. Percival declined to comment
In a statement US Facilities said Mr. Percival 's employment contract calls for him to act as a consultant to the company for two years
He will also remain a director US Facilities said but wo n't serve on any board committees
Mr. Percival will be succeeded on an interim basis by George Kadonada US Facilities chairman and president
In the same statement US Facilities also said it had bought back 112,000 of its common shares in a private transaction
Terms were n't disclosed
The buy-back represents about 3 % of the company 's shares based on the 3.7 million shares outstanding as of Sept. 30
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday US Facilities closed at 3.625 unchanged
Three leading drug companies reported robust third-quarter earnings bolstered by strong sales of newer big-selling prescriptions drugs that provide hefty profit margins
Merck & Co. reported a 25 % increase in earnings Warner-Lambert Co. 's profit rose 22 % and Eli Lilly & Co. 's net income rose 24 %
The results were in line with analysts ' expectations
Merck & Co
Merck Rahway N.J. continued to lead the industry with a strong sales performance in the human and animal health-products segment
A stronger U.S. dollar reduced third-quarter and first-nine-month sales growth 2 % and 3 % respectively
International sales accounted for 47 % of total company sales for the nine months compared with 50 % a year earlier
Sales for the quarter rose to 1.63 billion from 1.47 billion
Mevacor Merck 's new cholesterol-lowering drug had higher sales than any other prescription medicine has ever achieved in the U.S. in the year following introduction the company said
The drug was introduced in West Germany this year
Intense competition however led to unit sales declines for a group of Merck 's established human and animal-health products including Aldomet and Indocin
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday Merck shares closed at 75.25 up 50 cents
Warner-Lambert Co
Warner-Lambert Morris Plains N.J. reported sales that were a record for any quarter and the eighth quarter in a row of 20 % or more per-share earnings growth
Spurred by growth in world-wide sales of the company 's prescription drugs Warner-Lambert said 1989 will be the best year in its history with per-share earnings expected to increase more than 20 % to about 6.10
Sales for the quarter rose to 1.11 billion from 1.03 billion
Prescription-drug world-wide sales rose 9 % in the quarter to 340 million U.S. sales rose 15 %
The segment 's growth was led by sales of the cardiovascular drugs Lopid a lipid regulator and Dilzem a calcium channel blocker
World-wide sales of Warner-Lambert 's non-prescription health-care products such as Halls cough tablets Rolaids antacid and Lubriderm skin lotion increased 3 % to 362 million in the third quarter U.S. sales rose 5 %
Confectionery products sales also had strong growth in the quarter
World-wide sales of Trident gum Certs breath mints and Clorets gum and breath mints increased 12 % to 277 million
Warner-Lambert shares closed at 109.50 a share up 1.50 in Big Board composite trading yesterday
Eli Lilly & Co
Lilly attributed record third-quarter and nine-month results to world-wide gains for pharmaceuticals medical instruments and plant-science products despite poor exchange rates for the dollar that slowed sales abroad
Earnings continued to pace sales because of a lower tax rate profit from the renegotiation of the debt instrument received from Faberge Inc. in connection with Lilly 's sale of Elizabeth Arden Inc. in 1987 and net proceeds from the settlement of patent litigation at Lilly 's Hybritech Inc. unit
Third-quarter sales of the Indianapolis Ind. company rose 11 % to 1.045 billion from 940.6 million
Nine-month sales grew 12 % to 3.39 billion from 3.03 billion a year earlier
Sales of Prozac an anti-depressant led drug-sales increases
Higher sales of pesticides and other plant-science products more than offset a slight decline in the sales of animal-health products to fuel the increase in world-wide agricultural product sales Lilly said
Advanced Cardiovascular Systems Inc. and Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. units led growth in the medical-instrument systems division
Lilly shares closed yesterday in composite trading on the Big Board at 62.25 down 12.5 cents
Reuben Mark chairman of Colgate-Palmolive Co. said he is comfortable with analysts ' estimates that third-quarter earnings rose to between 95 cents and 1.05 a share
That compares with per-share earnings from continuing operations of 69 cents the year earlier including discontinued operations per-share was 88 cents a year ago
The per-share estimates mean the consumer-products company 's net income increased to between 69.5 million and 76 million from 47.1 million the year-before period
Analysts estimate Colgate 's world-wide third-quarter sales rose about 8 % to 1.29 billion
Mr. Mark attributed the earnings growth to strong sales in Latin America Asia and Europe
Results were also bolstered by a very meaningful increase in operating profit by Colgate 's U.S. business Mr. Mark said
Operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. household products and personal-care businesses jumped 25 % in the quarter Mr. Mark added
He said the improvement was a result of cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations blending two sales organizations and focusing more carefully the company 's promotional activities
The estimated improvement in Colgate 's U.S. operations took some analysts by surprise
Colgate 's household products business which includes such brands as Fab laundry detergent and Ajax cleanser has been a weak performer
Analysts estimate Colgate 's sales of household products in the U.S. were flat for the quarter and they estimated operating margins at only 1 % to 3 %
If you could say their business in the U.S. was mediocre but great everywhere else that would be fine says Bonita Austin an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Co
But it 's not mediocre it 's a real problem
Mr. Mark conceded that Colgate 's domestic business apart from its highly profitable Hill 's Pet Products unit has lagged
We 've done a lot to improve U.S.
results and a lot more will be done Mr. Mark said
Improving profitability of U.S. operations is an extremely high priority in the company
To focus on its global consumer-products business Colgate sold its Kendall health-care business in 1988
H. Anthony Ittleson was elected a director of this company which primarily has interests in radio and television stations increasing the number of seats to five
Osborn also operates Muzak franchises entertainment properties and small cable-television systems
Mr. Ittleson is executive special projects at CIT Group Holdings Inc. which is controlled by Manufacturers Hanover Corp
The Boston Globe says its newly redesigned pages have a crisper look with revamped fixtures aimed at making the paper more consistent and easier to read
Maybe so if you can find where your favorite writer went
Beantown scribes who spare no invective when taking on local luminaries such as Michael Pee Wee Dukakis or New England Patriots Coach Raymond Rev. Ray Berry yesterday poured ridicule on new drawings of Globe columnists that replaced old photos in the revamped pages this week
By late last night Globe Managing Editor Thomas Mulvoy bending to the will of his troops scrapped the new drawings
For a few days at least he says no pictures or drawings of any kind will adorn the columns
Trouble was nobody thought they looked right
Globe columnist Mike Barnicle in the second attack on his employer in as many weeks averred that his shadowy countenance was so bad it looked like a face you 'd find on a bottle of miracle elixir that promises to do away with diarrhea in our lifetime
Mr. Barnicle reminded readers that he still has n't forgiven Globe management for questioning a 20 expense chit he submitted for parking his car while chasing a story
I thought the drawing a cross between someone you 'd spot whipping open his trench coat or a guy who boasted he 'd been Charles Manson 's roommate for the last 19 years he said
Mr. Barnicle was hardly kinder to the renderings of colleagues Michael Madden appears to be a pervert Will McDonough looks as if he drove for Abe Lincoln or Bella English whose little girl now screams hysterically every time she sees a newspaper
Lynn Staley the Globe 's assistant managing editor for design acknowledges that the visages were on the low end of the likeness spectrum
Rival Boston Herald columnist Howie Carr who usually rails at Statehouse hacks and nepotism argued that the new drawings were designed to hide Mr. Madden 's rapidly growing forehead and the facial defects of chinless Dan Shaughnessy a Globe sports columnist
But think of the money you the reader will save on Halloween said Mr. Barnicle
Instead of buying masks for your kids just cut out the columnists ' pictures
Deeply ingrained in both the book review Kissing Nature Good-bye by Stephen MacDonald Leisure & Arts Sept. 27 and the books reviewed is the assumption that global warming is entirely a result of human activity
Is such a view justified In the absence of humans would the Earth enjoy a constant climate over the long term Clearly not
About 20,000 years ago the last ice age ended
Enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of North America northern Europe and Asia
This global warming must have been entirely natural nobody would blame it on a few hundred thousand hunter-gatherers hunting mammoths and scratching around in caves
Furthermore no bell has yet rung to announce the end of this immense episode of natural global warming
It is probably continuing and may well account for most of or all of present-day global warming
I bow to no one in my regard for our terrestrial heritage but if we are serious about global warming we must look at the big picture and not allow the Dominant Culture to lock us into the capitalist-exploiters-greedy-American-consumers-global warming scenario as the sole model for discussion
Jocelyn Tomkin Astronomy Department University of The Internal Revenue Service plans to restructure itself more like a private corporation
In addition the tax-collecting agency says that it will take the unusual step of looking to the private sector to fill two new high-level positions to guide the 120,000-employee agency a comptroller to oversee daily finances and a chief information officer to update the information system which includes probably the largest computer data base in the world
The IRS also said that it would create the position of chief financial officer who will be hired from within the agency
IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg said the changes are intended to bring accountability to the agency which has an annual budget of more than 5 billion and collects about 1 trillion a year
My assessment and everyone 's assessment is that we do not have the kinds of information that let us responsibly and effectively formulate and execute our budget Mr. Goldberg said
And we do n't have internal controls and discipline that we need to have to spend 5 billion properly
Mr. Goldberg who took over as head of the IRS in July has been disturbed by what he considers the inefficiency waste and lack of coordination among the branches of the vast federal agency
The IRS operates on a computer system designed in 1961 which it has been trying to modernize for years
And the agency which operated throughout fiscal 1989 with a 360 million budget shortfall has been under a hiring freeze since last fall
The new commissioner says that closer scrutiny of how the agency uses its resources will go a long way toward enhancing its ability to collect more tax revenue
I think that you will see a significant improvement in the budget formulation and execution process which in turn I believe will result in a significant increase in revenue he said
The IRS hopes to fill the new positions soon
Customarily it would appoint career civil servants from within the agency but Mr. Goldberg said he plans to scour the world for the chief information officer and the comptroller
Although the jobs will probably pay between 70,000 and 80,000 a year IRS officials are confident that they can attract top-notch candidates from the private sector
You 're telling someone they can spend the next three or four or five or six years of their life bringing about the most difficult and costly modernization of an information system on the civil side ever Mr. Goldberg said
On the comptroller side you 're developing and making work financial controls governing a 6 billion budget
When Maj. Moises Giroldi the leader of the abortive coup in Panama was buried his body bore several gunshot wounds a cracked skull and broken legs and ribs
They were the signature of his adversary Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega
The rebel officer 's slow and painful death at the headquarters of Panama 's Battalion-2000 squad was personally supervised by Gen. Noriega says a U.S. official with access to intelligence reports
Leaping into rages sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust Mr. Noriega has put to death some 70 of his troops involved in the coup according to U.S. officials monitoring crematoriums and funeral parlors in Panama City
He is now changing the place he sleeps every night sometimes more than once a night
His meals are most often prepared by women he trusts his full-time mistress Vicky Amado and her mother Norma
And he is collecting the names of those who telephoned the coup-makers to congratulate them during their brief time in control of his headquarters
More enemies to be dealt with
In the two weeks since the rebellion which the U.S. hesitantly backed Mr. Noriega has been at his most brutal and efficient in maintaining power
Yet while the failed coup is a major U.S. foreign policy embarrassment it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. Noriega and Washington that stretches back three decades
America 's war on the dictator over the past two years following his indictment on drug charges in February 1988 is the legacy of that relationship
Before American foreign policy set out to destroy Noriega it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama 's long history of conspirators and pirates
For most of the past 30 years the marriage was one of convenience
In 1960 for example when Mr. Noriega was both a cadet at an elite military academy in Peru and a spy-in-training for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency he was detained by Lima authorities for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute according to a U.S. Embassy cable from that period
The woman had nearly died
But U.S. intelligence rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy merely filed the report away
Mr. Noriega 's tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more important to U.S. interests
From that point on the U.S. would make a practice of overlooking the Panamanian 's misadventures
The U.S. has befriended and later turned against many dictators but none quite so resourceful
The 55-year-old Mr. Noriega is n't as smooth as the shah of Iran as well-born as Nicaragua 's Anastasio Somoza as imperial as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines or as bloody as Haiti 's Baby Doc Duvalier
Yet he has proved more resilient than any of them
And out of necessity The U.S. can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power but a single error on his part could cost him his life
The U.S. underestimated Noriega all along says Ambler Moss a former Ambassador to Panama
He has mastered the art of survival
In keeping with America 's long history of propping up Mr. Noriega recent U.S. actions have extended rather than shortened his survival
Mr. Noriega might have fallen of his own weight in 1988 because of Panama 's dire economic situation says Mr. Moss but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement
If the U.S. had sat back and done nothing he might not have made it through 1988 Mr. Moss contends
Perhaps most important Mr. Noriega 's allies have intervened to encourage in some cases to demand that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne
One Colombian drug boss upon hearing in 1987 that Gen. Noriega was negotiating with the U.S. to abandon his command for a comfortable exile sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name
He is cornered says the Rev. Fernando Guardia who has led Catholic Church opposition against Noriega
The Americans have left him without a way out
It is easy to fight when you do n't have any other option
His chief advantage in the fight his intimate knowledge of American ways and weaknesses
Mr. Noriega often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the gringos who have a short attention span and little stomach for lasting confrontation
The U.S. discovered the young Tony Noriega in late 1959 when he was in his second year at the Chorrillos Military Academy in Lima according to former U.S. intelligence officials
The contact occurred through Mr. Noriega 's half-brother a Panamanian diplomat based in Peru named Luis Carlos Noriega Hurtado
Luis Carlos knowing that helping the Americans could advance the career of any Panamanian officer relayed Tony 's reports on the leftist tendencies he observed among his fellow students and more important among his officers and instructors
A spy was born
It was a heady experience for the pockmarked and slightly built Mr. Noriega who was known to his friends as Cara la Pina pineapple face
Born the illegitimate son of his father 's maid he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of Panama City
Tony was four years older than most of his fellow cadets and gained admission to the academy because his brother had falsified his birth certificate
He considered himself intellectually superior to his Peruvian peers many of whom were wayward sons sent by their well-off families to the highly disciplined French-modeled academy as a sort of reform school
In his peaked military cap and neatly pressed French-made uniform Noriega felt more respected and powerful than ever in his underprivileged life friends from the period say
He had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a country where there was a cult of militarism where officers were the elite with special privileges recalls Darien Ayala a fellow student in Peru and a lifelong friend
Mr. Noriega 's relationship to American intelligence agencies became contractual in either 1966 or 1967 intelligence officials say
His commanding officer at the Chiriqui Province garrison Major Omar Torrijos gave him an intriguing assignment Mr. Noriega would organize the province 's first intelligence service
The spy network would serve two clients the Panamanian government by monitoring political opponents in the region and the U.S. by tracking the growing Communist influence in the unions organized at United Fruit Co. 's banana plantations in Bocas del Toros and Puerto Armuelles
United Fruit was one of the two largest contributors to Panama 's national income
Satisfying its interests was a priority for any Panamanian leader
Mr. Noriega 's initial retainer was only 50 to 100 a month plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the American PX a former intelligence official says
It was modest pay by American standards but a healthy boost to his small military salary which fellow officers remember as having been 300 to 400 monthly
He did it very well recalls Boris Martinez a former Panamanian colonel who managed Mr. Noriega and his operation
He started building the files that helped him gain power
A National Guard job assumed by Capt. Noriega in 1964 as chief of the transit police in David City capital of the Chiriqui Province was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy
By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses he gained a ready cache of information
He knew which local luminaries had been caught driving drunk which had been found with their mistresses
This proved particularly valuable to the Panamanian government in 1967 when union leaders were planning a May Day march that the government feared could turn violent
Mr. Noriega had learned that a local union leader was sleeping with the wife of his deputy
So he splashed the information on handbills that he distributed throughout the banana-exporting city of Puerto Armuelles which was ruled by United Fruit Co
The campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier to control
It was like a play on Broadway recalls Mr. Martinez
Noriega managed the whole thing
He was superb
Noriega was an expert at bribing and blackmailing people
During his years in Chiriqui however Mr. Noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious
Rodrigo Miranda a local lawyer and human-rights monitor recalls an intoxicated Noriega visiting prisoners in their cells at the 5th Zone Garrison headquarters in David where he had his offices
Mr. Noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked laughing at them and then retreating to his office
People started wondering if something was wrong with him Mr. Miranda recalls
But through this period so far as the U.S. military was concerned Mr. Noriega was a model recruit
He signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under American officers at Fort Gulick in Panama in July 1967 according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details Mr. Noriega has since classified as secret
He flew to Fort Bragg N.C. in September of that year for a course in psychological operations returning to the School of the Americas in Panama for a two-month course called military intelligence for officers
Some American officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty but they did so falsely
He rose to chief of intelligence in Panama 's socalled G-2 in 1970 after providing populist dictator Torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier
He became Gen. Torrijos 's inseparable shadow and the holder of all Panama 's secrets
Mr. Noriega by now a lieutenant colonel expanded his contacts to include the Cubans not to mention the Israelis the Taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking
When U.S. diplomats complained to the CIA of Col. Noriega 's moonlighting intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the Americans
Early on in the State Department we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and the United States recalls Francis J. McNeil who as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs first ran across reports about Mr. Noriega in 1977
Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans
Even at this early stage drugs caused additional concerns
During the Nixon administration the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G-2 's connections to arrested drug traffickers
One DEA agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with Col. Noriega one of which was assassination
The head of the DEA at the time John Ingersoll scotched the assassination plan
But he did fly to Panama to scold dictator Torrijos on the drug ties of Panamanian officials including Mr. Noriega
Mr. Ingersoll later recalled that Gen. Torrijos seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the U.S.
Everybody was afraid of him Mr. Ingersoll says
Mr. Noriega became an even greater threat in 1976 when U.S. intelligence services discovered that he had been buying recordings of electronically monitored conversations from three sergeants working for the U.S. Army 's 470th Military Intelligence Group
The tapes included wiretaps of Gen. Torrijos 's own phone according to American intelligence officials
We caught him with his hands on our cookie jar says former CIA Director Stansfield Turner
For the first time the U.S. considered cutting Mr. Noriega from its intelligence payroll and the deliberations were intense Mr. Turner says
In the world of intelligence if you want to get information you get it from seedy characters
The question is how much you get tied in with seedy characters so they can extort you
Intelligence officials to this day worry whether Mr. Noriega sold sensitive information on the recordings to the Cubans or others
Mr. Turner was troubled enough to cancel the U.S. contract with the rent-a-colonel at the beginning of the Carter administration
The U.S. soon found new cause for concern gun-running
Prosecutors in Southern Florida indicted five Panamanians on charges of illegally running arms to Sandinista rebels trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government of Mr. Somoza
They included one of Mr. Noriega 's closest friends and business partners Carlos Wittgreen
And the investigators were quickly closing in on Mr. Noriega himself
At the time though in 1979 the U.S. was once again flirting with its longtime Latin American spy
Mr. Noriega made plans to fly to Washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the Pentagon
Dade County and federal authorities learning that he intended to fly through Miami made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil
It was a Friday in June
The Pentagon foiled the plan
According to military officers at the time word was passed to Mr. Noriega by his American hosts that the police would be waiting
On Monday U.S. officials received a routine unclassified message from the military group commander in Panama
Due to health reasons Lt. Col. Noriega has elected to postpone his visit to Washington it read
Prosecutors in Miami received yet another setback
Their original indictment against Mr. Wittgreen the friend of Mr. Noriega and the other four was dismissed on a technicality
But now along with reindicting Mr. Noriega 's pal they intended to charge Mr. Noriega himself on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of some 2 million in arms
In January 1980 Jerome Sanford as assistant U.S. attorney was summoned to a meeting with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent assigned to the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms in Miami
Panamanian dictator Torrijos he was told had granted the shah of Iran asylum in Panama as a favor to Washington
Mr. Sanford was told Mr. Noriega 's friend Mr. Wittgreen would be handling the shah 's security
It would n't be a good idea to indict him much less Mr. Noriega the prosecutor was told
After prodding from Mr. Sanford U.S. Attorney Jack Eskenazi pleaded with Justice Department officials in Washington to let the indictment proceed
Unfortunately Mr. Eskenazi wrote in a letter those of us in law enforcement in Miami find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the United States but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control
The letter along with a detailed prosecution memo sat on the desks of Justice officials for months before the case died a quiet death
I think if we had been allowed to go ahead then we would n't have the problems we have now Mr. Sanford says
If he had been found guilty we could have stopped him
In August 1983 Mr. Noriega took over as General and de-facto dictator of Panama having maneuvered his way to the top only two years after the mysterious death in a plane crash of his old boss Omar Torrijos
Soon the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses
The Reagan administration also put Mr. Noriega 's G-2 back on the U.S. payroll
Payments averaged nearly 200,000 a year from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA
Although working for U.S. intelligence Mr. Noriega was hardly helping the U.S. exclusively
During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas
He allegedly entered into Panama 's first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses according to Floyd Carlton a pilot who once worked for Mr. Noriega and who testified before the U.S. grand jury in Miami that would ultimately indict the Panamanian on drug charges
But Mr. Noriega was convinced the Reagan White House would n't act against him recalls his close ally Jose Blandon because he had an insurance policy his involvement with the Contra rebels in Nicaragua
Mr. Blandon says the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama
Mr. Noriega also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the Nicaraguan capital of Managua
And on at least one occasion in the spring of 1985 he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a Sandinista arsenal in Nicaragua
Although his help for the Contra cause was limited it was enough to win him important protectors in the Reagan administration says Sen. Patrick Leahy a Vermont Democrat who then served on the Senate Intelligence Committee
Noriega played U.S. intelligence agencies and the U.S. government like a violin he says
An incident in 1984 suggested one additional means by which Mr. Noriega might have maintained such influence with Washington by compromising U.S. officials
Curtin Windsor then the ambassador to Costa Rica recalls being invited to Panama by Mr. Noriega 's brother Luis Carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and quiet serious conversation on the Aswara Peninsula
Mr. Windsor notified Everett E. Briggs the U.S. ambassador to Panama of the invitation
Briggs screamed Mr. Windsor recalls
He says Mr. Briggs told him he was being set up for a honey trap in which Mr. Noriega would try to involve him in an orgy and then record the event with sound and video
Mr. Briggs on vacation after resigning his position at the National Security Council could n't be reached for comment
As Mr. Noriega 's political troubles grew so did his offers of assistance to the Contras an apparent attempt to curry more favor in Washington
For instance he helped steal the May 1984 Panamanian elections for the ruling party
But just one month later he also contributed 100,000 to a Contra leader according to documents released for Oliver North 's criminal trial in Washington D.C
Yet his political setbacks mounted
Mr. Noriega was accused of ordering in 1985 the beheading of Hugo Spadafora his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger Mr. Noriega on drug trafficking charges
He then ousted President Nicholas Ardito Barletta a former World Bank official with close ties to the U.S. after Mr. Barletta tried to create a commission to investigate the murder
And all the while Panama 's debt problems continued to grow
Mr. Noriega was growing desperate
In late 1986 he made an offer he thought the U.S. could n't refuse
As recounted in a stipulation that summarized government documents released for the North trial Mr. Noriega offered to assassinate the Sandinista leadership in exchange for a promise to help clean up Noriega 's image and a commitment to lift the U.S.
ban on military sales to the Panamanian Defense Forces
North the document went on referring to Oliver North has told Noriega 's representative that U.S. law forbade such actions
The representative responded that Noriega had numerous assets in place in Nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things just as Noriega had helped the U.S.
the previous year in blowing up a Sandinista arsenal
Col. North conveyed the request to his superiors and to Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams who relayed it to Secretary of State George Shultz
Mr. Noriega 's proposal was turned down
And Mr. Shultz curtly told Mr. Abrams that the general should be told that only he could repair his tarnished image
The end of the marriage was at hand
Within weeks the unfolding Iran-Contra scandal took away Mr. Noriega 's insurance policy
The death of CIA Director William Casey and resignation of Oliver North allowed anti-Noriega political forces to gain influence
Public protests against him were triggered in June 1987 due to charges by Diaz Herrera his former chief of staff that Mr. Noriega had stolen the 1984 election and had ordered the killing of Messrs. Spadafora and Torrijos
Few American officials were willing any longer to defend him
Lawyers in Miami this time working virtually without impediment prepared to have him indicted on drug charges in February 1988
During negotiations with American officials in May 1988 over proposals to drop the U.S. indictments in exchange for his resignation Mr. Noriega often asked almost plaintively how the Americans whom he had helped for so many years could turn against him
Now neither side the U.S. nor Mr. Noriega has an easy out
President Bush has sworn to bring him to justice
Mr. Noriega believes he has n't any alternative but to continue clutching to power
It is a knock-out battle perhaps to the death
In the end is Mr. Noriega the political equivalent of Frankenstein 's monster created by a well-intentioned but misguided foreign power Not quite Sen. Leahy contends
For short-term gains people were willing to put up with him
That allowed him to get stronger and stronger he says
I do n't think we created him as much as we fed him nurtured him and let him grow up to be big and strong
UPJOHN Co. reported that third-quarter net income rose to 96 million or 52 cents a share from 89.6 million or 49 cents a share a year earlier
Yesterday 's edition provided analysts ' estimates for the company when actual earnings were available
Industrial production declined 0.1 % in September reinforcing other signs that the manufacturing sector continues its slowing trend
The Federal Reserve Board said output of the nation 's factories mines and utilities expanded at an annual rate of 1.3 % in the third quarter substantially slower than the 3.3 % annual rate in the second quarter
Capital spending and exports which have been the driving force in this expansion are showing clear signs of having the steam taken out of them said Robert Dederick economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago
The new reports of sluggishness which were foreshadowed by an earlier Labor Department report that manufacturing payrolls dropped by 105,000 in September give the Fed another reason to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates
They need to do something about this said Maury Harris economist at PaineWebber Group Inc
The Fed also said U.S. industry operated at 83.6 % of capacity last month down from 83.8 % in August
Measures of manufacturing activity fell more than the overall measures
Factory output dropped 0.2 % its first decline since February after having been unchanged in October
Factories operated at 83.7 % of capacity the lowest rate in more than a year and down from 84.1 % in September
The declines mainly reflected widespread weakness in durable goods those intended to last more than three years
The biggest drop was recorded by primary metals producers a category that includes the steel industry
Output of business equipment was unchanged in September
Production of factory equipment one indication of the strength of manufacturers ' investment spending fell 0.3 %
Some economists expect further declines in investment spending
Whenever corporate profits are weak that means capital spending is going to soften subsequently Mr. Harris said
You have n't seen the full effect of that yet
A decline in truck production more than offset a sharp rise in auto assemblies the Fed noted
Analysts do n't expect the September surge in auto production to be repeated in the coming months
Here is a summary of the Federal Reserve Board 's report on industrial production in September
The figures are seasonally adjusted
142.3 % of the 1977 average

Lung-cancer mortality rates for people under 45 years of age have begun to decline federal researchers report
The drop is particularly large for white males although black males and white and black women also show lower mortality rates
A report in this week 's issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute also projects that overall U.S. mortality rates from lung cancer the leading cause of cancer death should begin to drop in several years if cigarette smoking continues to abate
The report which comes 25 years after the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report warning against the dangers of smoking is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer
What this is saying is that the surgeon general 's message is having an impact said Melvyn Tockman an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore
The National Cancer Institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of people between the ages of 35 and 44 a decade apart
The death rate from lung cancer of white males aged 35 to 44 in the mid-1970s was 13.4 per 100,000 but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was 9.6 a decline of 28.7 %
Measured the same way the decline for black males was 14.2 %
The drop in mortality rates for women was less steep 8.9 % for blacks and 5.3 % for whites
The study by Susan Devesa William Blot and Joseph Fraumeni of the institute 's staff also shows that the incidence of lung cancer as well as the death rate declined over the decade for all groups in the 35-44 age bracket except black men
Although lung-cancer mortality rates are increasing for the nation as a whole the report projects that death rates will begin to decline in the 1990s for men and after the year 2000 for women
Lung-cancer mortality rates increase with age and are continuing to rise for all age groups over 55 with sharp increases for everybody but white men
But Dr. Fraumeni one of the authors of the report said the declining rates we 're seeing for younger people we believe may be a harbinger of declining mortality in the future
However he stressed that the improvement depends on a continued reduction in smoking
Even though these favorable trends in lung-cancer mortality affect all sex and race groups they ca n't be taken for granted the report says
Smoking prevention programs should reach larger segments of the population especially children adolescents and minorities
An editorial in the NCI Journal says the report of declining lung-cancer mortality among young men and women in the U.S. indicates that we finally may be winning the battle this even in a country where the tobacco industry spends over 2 billion a year for promotion of the addictive habit of smoking
But the editorial by Jan Stjernsward of the World Health Organization notes that tobacco consumption and lung-cancer mortality rates are rising in developing countries
Non-smoking should be established as the norm of social behavior around the world the editorial says through the enactment of laws that limit advertising boost tobacco prices and promote anti-smoking education
Asked for comment Walker Merryman a vice president of the Tobacco Institute said new efforts to restrict tobacco advertising in the U.S. could violate the First Amendment protection of free speech
According to the American Cancer Society smoking is responsible for 85 % of the lung-cancer cases among men and 75 % among women
The NCI report attributes the differences in mortality rates by race to different smoking patterns
A higher proportion of black men smoke than white men
While nearly equal percentages of black and white women currently smoke in both sexes more whites have given up smoking than blacks
In comparing changes in mortality rates over the past decade the NCI study looked only at blacks and whites
Asians and native Americans were n't studied Hispanics were included with whites

A lot of the professional traders are just going back and forth
They 're just as confused

Certainly conservative environmentalists can defend their limited government position by differentiating between Old Environmentalism and New Environmentalism Journalists and Others for Saving the Planet by David Brooks editorial page Oct. 5
Old Environmentalism involved microbe hunters and sanitationists
It started with improvements in hygiene made possible by affordable soap and washable underwear during the Industrial Revolution
Then cast-iron sewer pipe and the flush toilet were followed by sewage and water-treatment plants toward the end of the 19th century
Medicine in the 19th century was dedicated mostly to combating sepsis and diagnostic analysis
Then the 20th century saw the evolution of private-sector wonder drugs which promulgated medical therapy
The process dramatically increased our average life expectancy eliminated much pain and constantly improved health and well-being
Most public-health measures were handled at the local level
New Environmentalism probably started in 1962 with the publication of Rachel Carson 's book Silent Spring
Shortly thereafter hysterical articles began to appear predicting that advanced industrial societies would produce a blackened uninhabitable planet possibly by the turn of the century
These apocalyptic predictions were advanced by such stalwarts as Paul Ehrlich Barry Commoner Rene Dubois and George Wald
Writing in the 1960s Ms. Carson suggested that the human race could be eliminated in 20 years and Mr. Wald suggested that life on earth might end by 1985
Mr. Ehrlich predicted unprecedented famine by 1980
There were many more
Thousands of chemical products were categorized as carcinogenic with recommendations that they be banned from industrial use because they produced malignant tumors in overdosed rats
Unknown before 1960 were the inconclusive effects of acid rain greenhouse warming and ozone depletion all of which required burgeoning political power and gargantuan expense
Meanwhile the New Environmentalists systematically opposed the methods of the Old Environmentalists
Local pollution problems require cheap energy and capital for their solution
But the New Environmentalists oppose private wealth creation which they claim depletes natural resources and nuclear power even though it would counteract the greenhouse effect
They are in the forefront of opposing the search for new landfills and methods of incineration and even oppose new methods of research such as genetic engineering
New Environmentalism is an emotional attack on proven methods of improving our quality of life and a bid for political power
Let 's rationalize our priorities by solving pollution problems at the local level as heretofore
Harry Lee Smith Alpharetta Ga
Your story missed some essential points of the conference on The Global Environment Are We Overreacting First and foremost the vignettes presented by the various scientists represent a general consensus among specialists working in the respective aspects of the global environment
Consider for example the greenhouse effect and climate change numerous blue-ribbon scientific committees including one from the National Academy of Science judge there is a greater than 50 % probability of a grave problem in the offing
The point was to answer the question in the conference title not to try to create news stories for the event itself
Nor was it intended to dictate a set of prescriptive solutions although various points were raised
Each speaker was asked to address a specific topic not deliver a point of view
Each scientist independently concluded society and government are underreacting when it comes to substantive policy change
This leads to a very special sense of urgency
If the media decide to work harder at educating the public about these complex and technical issues that hardly can be termed non-objective journalism
The environment can no longer be a normal issue to be dealt with on a business-as-usual basis with comfortable increments of change
We have literally altered the chemistry and physics of our planet 's atmosphere
This portends consequences from what we have already done that will be very destabilizing to social and economic systems
The problems of the environment are so interrelated so inextricably entwined with our current way of life and so large that it is unlikely we will be able to address them effectively unless major changes are made in less than 10 years
The consensus from the scientific community is that there is sufficient evidence to advise major policy changes
No we are not overreacting
Thomas E. Lovejoy Assistant Secretary for External Affairs Smithsonian Institution Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. fulfilling its dismal earnings forecast for 1989 said its third-quarter net income fell 68 % on flat revenue
Stung by higher marketing costs and slowing volume growth the giant Coke bottling operation said net fell to 12.7 million or six cents a share from 39.9 million or 26 cents a share the year earlier
The results met estimates of analysts who had already slashed their projections after the company said in late August that its 1989 earnings could tumble as much as 37 %
A company spokesman said yesterday that Coca-Cola Enterprises sticks by its 1989 forecast
Third-quarter revenue was flat at 1.02 billion
The year-ago results however included the operations of a bottling business which was sold last December
Excluding that bottling business Coca-Cola Enterprises ' volume measured by cases of soda rose only 1 %
The volume is well below the industry 's 4 % to 5 % growth rate of recent years but in line with other soft-drink companies for the third quarter
The latest third-quarter volume also compares with a very strong 10 % growth in the year-ago quarter
Coca-Cola Enterprises blamed the lower volume on its soft-drink prices which were about 3 % higher in the third quarter
Consumers have been accustomed to buying soft-drinks at discounted prices for several years
Coca-Cola Enterprises said it had to boost spending for trade and dealer incentives to try to keep volumes from slipping
The company said it expects consumers will adjust to higher-priced soft drinks
A spokesman attributed the bulk of a 14 % increase in selling administrative and general expenses to 324.9 million to marketing costs
They 're out there promoting like crazy trying to get prices up by promotion said Roy Burry an analyst with Kidder Peabody & Co
For the nine months Coca-Cola Enterprises ' net fell 31 % to 65 million or 39 cents a share from 93.8 million or 63 cents a share
Revenue was flat at about 2.97 billion
Coca-Cola Enterprises which is 49%-owned by Coca-Cola Co. also said it repurchased about 1.2 million of its common shares during the third quarter
The buy-back is part of a 25-million-share repurchase plan under which Coca-Cola Enterprises so far has acquired a total of 9.7 million shares
Separately Purchase N.Y.-based PepsiCo Inc. as expected said fiscal third-quarter net rose 11 % to 269.3 million or 1.02 a share from 241.6 million or 91 cents a share
Sales rose 25 % to 3.90 billion from 3.13 billion
The year-ago quarter 's results include an after-tax charge of 5.9 million from the sale of a winery in Spain
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Coca-Cola Enterprises closed at 16.375 a share down 62.5 cents
PepsiCo closed at 58.50 a share up 1.375
L.J. Hooker Corp. is expected to reach an agreement in principle this week to sell Merksamer Jewelers Inc. to management say executives familiar with the talks
L.J. Hooker based in Atlanta filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year
Currently its parent company Hooker Corp. of Sydney Australia is being managed by a court-appointed liquidator
It is expected that GE Capital Corp. a financial-services subsidiary of General Electric Co. will provide much of the funding for the proposed leveraged buy-out of Merksamer based in Sacramento Calif
A spokesman for GE Capital declined to comment
GE Capital has a working relationship with L.J. Hooker
It is providing 50 million in emergency financing to the company and has agreed to buy as much as 75 million in receivables from B. Altman & Co. and Bonwit Teller L.J. Hooker 's two fully owned department-store chains
Sam Merksamer chief executive officer of the nationwide jewelry chain and Sanford Sigoloff chief executive of L.J. Hooker Corp. both declined to comment
Currently Mr. Merksamer owns 20 % of the company L.J. Hooker acquired its 80 % interest in the firm in May 1986
At the time the Merksamer chain had 11 stores in operation
Today there are 77 units all located in shopping malls
In recent weeks Mr. Merksamer has approached a number of his suppliers and asked them to provide letters of intent saying they will continue shipping merchandise to the chain following the buy-out say those familiar with the situation
This year a number of retail leveraged buyouts have failed causing jitters among suppliers and Mr. Merksamer apparently wanted assurances that he wo n't have delivery problems
For the year ended June 30 1989 Merksamer Jewelers had 62 million of revenue and operating profit of 2.5 million
The jewelery chain was put up for sale in June
According to those familiar with the situation other bidders included Ratners Group PLC of London and Kay Jewelers Inc
First Boston Corp. is advising L.J. Hooker on the sale of the Merksamer business
Merksamer was the first in a series of retail acquisitions made by L.J. Hooker
The company was founded in Sacramento in 1929 by two brothers Ralph and Walter Merksamer who operated as DeVon 's Jewelers
In 1979 the pair split the company in half with Walter and his son Sam agreeing to operate under the Merksamer Jewelery name
The sale of Merksamer Jewelers is subject to approval by Judge Tina Brozman of U.S. Bankruptcy Court
As earlier reported L.J. Hooker this week received a 409 million bid for its three shopping malls plus other properties from a consortium led by Honolulu real-estate investor Jay Shidler and A. Boyd Simpson an Atlanta developer and former L.J. Hooker senior executive
The offer which did n't include the Merksamer chain is being reviewed by Mr. Sigoloff

The days may be numbered for animated shows featuring Alf the Karate Kid and the Chipmunks
NBC a leader in morning prime-time and late night programs but an also-ran on Saturday mornings when children rule the TV set is contemplating getting out of the cartoon business
Instead network officials say it may counterprogram with shows for an audience that is virtually ignored in that time period adults
There is talk of some revamping and we 're certainly heading in the direction of less and less animation said Joseph S. Cicero vice president of finance and administration for National Broadcasting Co. a unit of General Electric Co
Mr. Cicero said that NBC Entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff who declined to be interviewed is looking at options now and may put some things into the schedule by mid-season
He declined to elaborate
NBC 's options could range from news-oriented programming to sports shows although the network declined to comment
One major NBC affiliate KCRA in Sacramento plans to cancel the NBC Saturday morning line-up as of January and replace it with a local newscast
The one-hour program will be repeated with updates throughout Saturday mornings
We feel there is an opportunity for an audience that is not being served by any network so we want to take the lead says KCRA 's general manager John Kueneke
We do n't need cartoons anymore
They only accounted for 5 % at best of the station 's total revenues
An NBC spokesman says the network will closely monitor the Sacramento situation and says it is the only station to defect
Spokesmen for the television networks of CBS Inc. and Capital Cities\/ABC Inc. say there are no plans to alter the children 's line-up on Saturday mornings
The youthful audience for Saturday programming is no longer dependent on the networks
There has been a surge in syndicated children 's shows to independent stations as well as competition from videocassettes for kids and from cable outlets such as Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel
At the same time there appears to be a market for news-oriented programming Turner Broadcasting System Inc. 's Cable News Network has its highest ratings outside of prime time on Saturday mornings
NBC has on previous occasions considered replacing cartoons with a Saturday version of Today which is produced by NBC News
The network 's own production company NBC Productions supplies a half-hour family-oriented show titled Saved By The Bell
NBC Productions or NBC News could supply the network with other Saturday morning shows a move that would control costs
Animated shows which are made by outside production companies cost the network about 300,000 per episode
Rohm & Haas Co. said third-quarter net income skidded 35 % to 32.6 million or 49 cents a share
In the year-earlier quarter the chemicals company had net of 49.8 million or 75 cents a share
Sales were 623 million up 0.5 % from 619.8 million a year ago
Rohm & Haas which plans to start operating seven new production units this year attributed the profit slide partly to higher start-up expense
The company also cited the stronger dollar which cuts the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars
In addition the company said it was hurt by higher than previous-year costs for raw materials though those costs have declined since the second quarter
Incrementally higher production of those chemicals which remain in heavy demand also has forced up costs such as overtime pay
For the nine months Rohm & Haas net totaled 155 million or 2.33 a share down 17 % from 187.8 million or 2.82 a share a year ago
Sales rose 5.2 % to 2.04 billion from 1.94 billion the previous year
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Rohm & Haas closed at 33 a share down 1.75

This is written to correct a misquotation in your Oct. 3 article Deaths From Advanced Colon Cancer Can Be Reduced by Using Two Drugs
In this article I was alleged to have said Any patient with high-risk colon cancer is really getting short shrift if he 's not getting this therapy
I did n't say this and I 'm totally opposed to the philosophy expressed by the quote
I have not offered and will not offer routine therapy with the two drugs levamisole and 5-fluorouracil to any of my colon-cancer patients
With this treatment we have reduced deaths in high-risk colon cancer by one-third but this leaves the two-thirds who are dying of cancer
This is not nearly good enough
I believe any physician who truly cares about cancer patients both today and tomorrow should offer the hope of something better than that
My statement read verbatim from a printed text available to all reporters attending the National Cancer Institute news conference was the following New clinical trials are already in operation seeking to improve these results
These research protocols offer to the patient not only the very best therapy which we have established today but also the hope of something still better
I feel any patient with high-risk cancer is getting short shrift if he is not offered this opportunity
We have very exciting prospects for far more impressive advances in the treatment of colon cancer during the years immediately ahead
This hope however will never be realized if we use levamisole and 5-fluorouracil as a stopping point

The oil and auto industries united in their dislike of President Bush 's proposal for cars that run on alternative fuels announced a joint research program that could turn up a cleaner-burning gasoline
Officials of the Big Three auto makers and 14 petroleum companies said they are setting out to find the most cost-effective fuel for reducing cities ' air-pollution problems with no bias toward any fuel in particular
However their search notably wo n't include natural gas or pure methanol the two front-running alternative fuels in tests to be completed by next summer
Instead the tests will focus heavily on new blends of gasoline which are still undeveloped but which the petroleum industry has been touting as a solution for automobile pollution that is choking urban areas
Environmentalists criticized the program as merely a public-relations attempt to head off a White House proposal to require a million cars a year that run on cleaner-burning fuels by 1997
While major oil companies have been experimenting with cleaner-burning gasoline blends for years only Atlantic Richfield Co. is now marketing a lower-emission gasoline for older cars currently running on leaded fuel
The initial 11 million research program will conduct the most extensive testing to date of reformulated gasolines said Joe Colucci head of fuels and lubricants at General Motors Corp. research laboratories
It will compare 21 different blends of gasolines with three mixtures of up to 85 % methanol
A second phase of research which is still being planned will test reformulated gasolines on newer engine technologies now being developed for use in 1992 or 1993 cars
There was no cost estimate for the second phase
The whole idea here is the automobile and oil companies have joint customers said Keith McHenry a senior vice president of technology at Amoco Corp
And we are looking for the most cost-effective way to clean up the air
But David Hawkins an environmental lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council said the research appears merely to be a way to promote reformulated gasoline
Oil and auto companies supported a move on Capitol Hill last week to gut Mr. Bush 's plans to require auto makers to begin selling alternative-fueled cars by 1995
Instead a House subcommittee adopted a clean-fuels program that specifically mentions reformulated gasoline as an alternative
The Bush administration has said it will try to resurrect its plan when the House Energy and Commerce Committee takes up a comprehensive clean-air bill
William Seidman chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Lincoln Savings & Loan Association should have been seized by the government in 1986 to contain losses that he estimated will cost taxpayers as much as 2 billion
Mr. Seidman who has been the nation 's top bank regulator inherited the problems of Lincoln based in Irvine Calif. after his regulatory role was expanded by the new savings-and-loan bailout law
He made his comments before House Banking Committee hearings to investigate what appears to be the biggest thrift disaster in a scandal-ridden industry
The inquiry also will cover the actions of Charles Keating Jr. who is chairman of American Continental Corp. Lincoln 's parent and who contributed heavily to several U.S. senators
Mr. Seidman told the committee that the Resolution Trust Corp. the agency created to sell sick thrifts has studied Lincoln 's examination reports by former regulators dating back to 1986
My staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own institutions we would have sought an immediate cease-and-desist order to stop the hazardous operations Mr. Seidman said
When Lincoln was seized by the government for example 15 % of its loans or 250 million were to borrowers who were buying real estate from one of American Continental 's 50 other subsidiaries according to Mr. Seidman
But the government did n't step in until six months ago when thrift officials put Lincoln into conservatorship the day after American Continental filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors
The bankruptcy filing the government has charged in a 1.1 billion civil lawsuit was part of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent company which used the deposits as a cache for real-estate deals
The deposits that have been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court
I think it 's fairly clear Mr. Keating knew that regulators were set to seize Lincoln Mr. Seidman said
Further investigation he said may result in further actions against Lincoln 's executives said Mr. Seidman including fraud actions
Mr. Keating for his part has filed suit alleging that regulators unlawfully seized the thrift
Leonard Bickwit an attorney in Washington for Mr. Keating declined to comment on the hearings except to say We will be responding comprehensively in several forums to each of these allegations at the appropriate time
Lincoln 's treatment by former thrift regulators in an agency disbanded by the new law has proved embarrassing for five senators who received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Mr. Keating
Mr. Seidman said yesterday for example that Sen. Dennis DeConcini D. Ariz. who received 48,100 in contributions from Mr. Keating phoned Mr. Seidman to request that he push for a sale of Lincoln before it would be seized
After the government lawsuit was filed against Lincoln Sen. DeConcini returned the campaign contributions
The senator 's spokesman said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of Lincoln because hundreds of Arizona jobs at Lincoln were on the line
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle D. Mich
has also returned contributions he received from Mr. Keating a year ago
Sens. John Glenn D. Ohio John McCain R. Ariz. and Alan Cranston D. Calif. also received substantial contributions from Mr. Keating and sought to intervene on behalf of Lincoln
House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez D. Texas said Sen. Cranston volunteered to appear before the House committee if necessary
But a committee staff member said the panel is unlikely to pursue closely the role of the senators
At the hearing Mr. Seidman said the RTC has already pumped 729 million into Lincoln for liquidity
He also held out little hope of restitution for purchasers of 225 million in American Continental subordinated debt
Some of those debtholders have filed a suit saying they believed they were buying government-insured certificates of deposit
We have no plans at this time to pay off those notes he said
Eastern Airlines ' creditors committee unhappy with the carrier 's plans for emerging from bankruptcy-law proceedings asked its own experts to devise alternate approaches to a reorganization
Representatives of the accounting firm of Ernst & Young and the securities firm of Goldman Sachs & Co. hired by creditors to consult on Eastern 's financial plans told the committee in a private meeting yesterday that Eastern 's latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection is far riskier than an earlier one which won the creditors ' approval
According to one person present at the meeting Eastern 's new plan is financially overly optimistic
Asked about the consultants ' reports an Eastern spokeswoman said we totally disagree
She said they have oversimplified and made some erroneous assumptions that make their analysis completely off-base
At a later news conference here Frank Lorenzo chairman of Eastern 's parent Texas Air Corp. said Eastern was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and predicted it would emerge from Chapter 11 protection from creditors early next year operating with more service than it originally had scheduled
He insisted as he has before that creditors would be paid in full under the plan
Mr. Lorenzo made no mention of creditors ' negative response to his plan
We 're in the process of discussing an amended plan with the creditors and anticipate filing that amended plan shortly Mr. Lorenzo told reporters
We 're meeting and surpassing our goals he added
In July Eastern and its creditors agreed on a reorganization plan that called for Eastern to sell 1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection at two-thirds its former size
But after selling off pieces such as its East Coast shuttle its Philadelphia hub and various planes Eastern hit a stumbling block
It could n't sell its South American routes one of the major assets marked for disposal
Those routes valued by the creditors ' professionals at about 400 million were to be sold to AMR Corp. 's American Airlines
A last-minute snag in negotiations with AMR over an unrelated lawsuit between American and another Texas Air unit caused the deal to collapse
Eastern ultimately decided it would have to keep and operate the routes itself which would leave it with less cash for its reorganization
It also would leave Eastern a bigger carrier than the scaled-down one proposed under the initial plan
Those changes in its condition meant the reorganization plan previously presented to creditors would have to be revamped
Since then Eastern has been negotiating with creditors over revisions but the creditors committee has been having problems with the revisions
The committee has two groups of experts it calls on to analyze Eastern 's plans
Both said the new plan would n't work
Ernst & Young said Eastern 's plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest tax and depreciation by 100 million and that Eastern 's plan presented no comfort level according to a source present at yesterday 's session
Experts from Goldman Sachs estimated Eastern would miss the same mark by 120 million to 135 million the source said
The experts said they expected Eastern would have to issue new debt to cover its costs and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated
Other costs also would increase including maintenance because Eastern has an older fleet
At the news conference Mr. Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes presented a far rosier assessment
Flanked by flight attendants pilots and gate agents dressed in spiffy new blue uniforms they said Eastern has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats
Starting next month Eastern will begin flying 775 flights daily instead of the previously announced 700 they said
Mr. Bakes declined to give out Eastern 's daily losses but said he did n't expect Eastern would have to dip into the cash from asset sales currently held in escrow
These accounts hold several hundred million dollars primarily from asset sales
The plan Eastern hopes to pursue he said calls for Eastern to have 390 million in cash by year 's end
Both he and Mr. Lorenzo predicted that plan might be confirmed in January
As to negotiations with creditors Mr. Lorenzo said in remarks after the conference we 'll have to see how they talks come along
However he added it 's not a requirement that the plan be accepted by creditors
It must be accepted by the court
Under bankruptcy law Eastern has exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its own reorganization plan
That deadline has been extended once and could be extended again
If Eastern can get creditor support court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift
But creditors are free to press for court approval of their own plan or the court could ignore both sides and draw its own
In any event some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by January as forecast by Mr. Lorenzo and Mr. Bakes
Eastern sought bankruptcy-law protection a few days after a crippling strike began March 4
Mr. Lorenzo told reporters the reorganization Eastern is pursuing would create a carrier 85 % to 90 % of the size of the pre-bankruptcy Eastern
He projected it would be operating about 1,000 flights a day by late spring only slightly fewer than the carrier 's old volume of 1,050 a day
HOPES OF SIMPLIFYING the corporate minimum tax before 1990 are weakening
The method of calculating the 20 % tax paid if it exceeds tax figured the regular way is due for a change in 1990 thanks to 1986 's tax act
But most experts agree that the concept that is to be introduced drags in great complexity they have been trying to head it off this year
Ways and Means Chairman Rostenkowski backed a simplification plan in the pending House tax bill but the plan turns out to be a big revenue loser
Now the Senate 's stripped-down bill omits any proposal to deal with the corporate tax
Proponents of simplification fear that the chances of getting it into the final bill are waning
We hear it has low priority on the House side says Samuel Starr of Coopers & Lybrand CPAs
If the law is n't changed he says we are left staring at rules that are almost impossible to implement because there are so many complex depreciation calculations to do
But Congress still could resolve the issue with other legislation this year or next Starr adds
HUGO 'S RAVAGES may be offset by immediate claims for tax refunds
This law aids hurricane-wracked locales named by the president as disaster areas as well as regions so designated after other 1989 disasters
It lets victims elect to deduct casualty losses on either 1989 or amended 1988 returns whichever offers the larger tax benefit they have until April 16 to choose
Amending a 1988 return to claim a refund brings cash faster but for personal losses there are other factors to consider notes publisher Prentice Hall
A loss after insurance recoveries is deductible only to the extent that it exceeds 100 and that the year 's total losses exceed 10 % of adjusted gross income victims may pick the year when income is lower and deductions higher
In filing an original not amended return a couple should consider whether damaged property is owned jointly or separately and whether one spouse has larger income that may determine whether they should file jointly or separately
THE IRS DELAYS several deadlines for Hugo 's victims
Returns for 1988 from people with six-month filing extensions were due Monday but the IRS says people in the disaster areas wo n't be penalized for late filing if their returns are marked Hugo and postmarked by Jan. 16
Interest will be imposed on unpaid taxes but late-payment penalties on the returns will be waived if the balance due and paid is 10 % or less of the liability
IRS Notice 89-136 describes this and other deadline relief for Hugo 's victims
Among the provisions Fiscal-year taxpayers with returns due last Monday wo n't be penalized if they file or request an extension and pay tax due by Nov. 15
Excise-tax returns due by Oct. 31 or Nov. 30 may be delayed to Jan. 16
Extensions ca n't be granted for filing employment-tax returns due Oct. 31 or for depositing withheld taxes but late penalties will be abated for deposits made by Nov. 15
The notice also grants relief for certain estate-tax returns

BIGGER THAN A BREADBOX was this cash hoarder 's reputation for honesty
People often cite frugality and distrust of banks to justify cash caches to the IRS
Gregory Damonne Brown of Fremont Calif. a hardworking reclusive young bachelor told that story to the Tax Court
But judges usually find the real aim is to escape tax on hidden income and the IRS said Brown must have had such income although it uncovered no source because he deposited 124,732 in a bank account in 1982-84 while reporting income of only 52,012
Brown 's story The deposits came from savings kept in a Tupperware breadbox he saved 47,000 in 1974-81 by living with family members and pinching pennies and 45,000 of secret gifts from his remorseful father who had abandoned the family in 1955
Brown had no proof but testimony of his mother and stepmother about his father and of an ex-employer about his honesty and habits satisfied a judge that Brown was truthful and his tale of gifts was possible
The IRS offered no evidence of hidden sources of taxable income so Judge Shields rejected its claims
BRIEFS Asked how he made charitable gifts of 26,350 out of reported two-year income of 46,892 Thomas H. McFall of Bryan Texas told the Tax Court he had understated his income
The court rejected his incredible claims denied his deductions and imposed a negligence penalty

Kay Peterson mounts her bicycle and grinds up yet another steep rocky path seemingly suitable only for mountain goats
After a tortuous climb she is rewarded by a picture-postcard vista a glade of golden aspens under an azure Indian-summer sky
This place is 12 miles into the back country a day-long trudge for a hiker but reached by Ms. Peterson and six others in a mere two hours of pedaling fat-tired mountain bikes
This says Ms. Peterson is what it 's all about
Twelve hundred miles away rangers at a Napa County Calif. state park are among the many who do n't quite share the enthusiasm
This summer speeding bikers were blamed for an accident in the Napa County park in which a horse spooked on a trail that was closed to bikers broke its leg
The animal had to be destroyed the bikers fled and were never found
In numerous parks near San Francisco rangers have been forced to close trails set up speed traps and use radar guns to curb fast and reckless riding
They have even sent helicopters in pursuit of bikers after hikers and equestrians complained they were being driven from trails
We were being overrun says Steve Fiala trails coordinator of the East Bay Regional Park District
Two years ago the district decided to limit the bikes to fire roads in its 65,000 hilly acres
From about 200,000 six years ago the number of mountain bikes in the U.S. is expected to grow to 10 million in 1990
At least half that growth will have come in the past three years alone
The controversy kicked up by the proliferation of these all-terrain bicycles is one of the most divisive storms to blow through the national conservation movement in recent memory
Bikers many of them ardent environmentalists proclaim their sport an efficient safe fitness-promoting way to get back to nature while asserting a right as taxpayers to pedal on public lands
But the bikes ' burgeoning numbers safety concerns and fear that they damage fragile landscapes have prompted pleas from the Sierras to the Eastern Seaboard to ban them from the back country
Key to the issue is that the bikes in skillful hands can go virtually anywhere and in reckless hands can become vehicles of terror
An adept bicyclist can leap from a dead stop to the top of a picnic table without losing balance
Such skills allow riders to fly down treacherous mountain grades at speeds of up to 40 miles an hour a thrill for the cyclist but a nightmare for unsuspecting hikers or equestrians
For harried public-land managers across the nation the response is increasingly to shut the gates
The state of California following the lead of some regional parks recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all hiking paths in state parks to mountain bicycles
The move largely consigns them to roads used by motorized vehicles
Most other states have enacted similar bans
The bikes are unwelcome on trails in national parks
Even the U.S. Forest Service whose lenient multiple-use philosophy permits motorized vehicles on thousands of miles of its trails across the U.S. has begun to close some lands to the bikes including major portions of the popular Pacific Crest Trail which stretches from California to Canada
Often these closings come after vigorous anti-bike lobbying by conservation organizations the politically potent Sierra Club among them
Sierra has been instrumental in securing a number of the California bans
It has been waging an all-out campaign to beat back a proposal pushed by Utah bike groups to allow the cycles in federally designated wilderness areas where they are now prohibited
Yet Sierra 's hard-line stance has created something of a rift in the organization which estimates that 17 % of its 500,000 members own mountain bikes
Pressure from these members prompted the club recently to soften its anti-bike rhetoric it no longer for example lumps the bikes into the same category as motorcycles and other terrain-marring off-road vehicles
But the club still insists that public lands ought to be closed to the bikes unless studies indicate the bikes wo n't injure the environment or other users
I have a mountain bike yet as a hiker I 've been run off the road by kids careening down a fire trail on them says Gene Coan an official at Sierra 's headquarters in San Francisco echoing the concerns of many members
People who feel that cyclists should be banned from an area are n't looking at the whole picture complains Mark Langton associate editor of Mountain and City Biking magazine in Canoga Park Calif
Mr. Langton is among the legions of bikers who got their first taste of wilderness as hikers or backpackers
He says fellow bikers show the same concern for the land that they demonstrated as hikers many are appalled that the conservation community would suddenly consider them the enemy
To fight back activists such as Mr. Langton are forming groups to lobby land managers over access issues and undertake education programs to show that the bikes can responsibly share trails
Mr. Langton 's group Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Association mounted petition drives to help keep open certain Santa Monica Mountain trails designated for closing
Biking groups in Montana Idaho Michigan and Massachusetts have won similar concessions says Tim Blumenthal mountain bike editor of Bicycling magazine
These groups have been trying to improve the mountain biker 's image in the San Francisco-area park district where a ranger was clobbered by a cyclist this summer bikers have formed a volunteer patrol to help rangers enforce regulations and to school riders in proper trail etiquette
Even staunch anti-bike Sierra members concede that 10 % of all riders cause most of the problems
While some are renegade riders who simply scorn regulations much bad riding simply reflects ignorance that can be corrected through education and peer pressure says Jim Hasenauer a director of the International Mountain Biking Association
I think we 're making progress
Few would have foreseen such a furor when a decade ago some Marin County bicycle enthusiasts created a hybrid bike using fat tires lightweight metallurgy and multi-gear technology
They wanted a machine that would allow them to pedal into rugged terrain then inaccessible to cycles
They got a machine more responsive more stable and in many ways easier to ride than the thin-tired racing bikes that then were the rage
When the bikes first entered mass production in 1981 they were dismissed as a fad
Last year 25 % of the 10 million bicycles sold in the U.S. were mountain bikes
In California a bellwether market they accounted for more than 80 % of all bike sales
The majority of the bikes never even make it into the high country
City dwellers love them because they shift smoothly in traffic bounce easily over curbs and roll through road glass with far fewer flat tires than racing bikes
Crested Butte population 1,200 is a bastion of the sport
By one estimate everyone here under 50 owns at least one bike
The town is home to the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame and it hosts the annual Fat Tire Bike Week
This summer the jamboree attracted more visitors than the busiest week of the town 's winter ski season
David Lindsey chairman of the Fat Tire Bike celebration muses that the bike 's popularity may be a combination of technology and nostalgia
The mountain bike feels as comfortable as the paperboy bike you had as a kid but it can do so much more he says

Weyerhaeuser Co. reported a one-time gain and strong wood-product sales that offset weakness in pulp and paper to fuel a 15 % jump in third-quarter net income to 166.8 million or 78 cents a share
In the 1988 third quarter the forest-products company reported profit of 144.9 million or 69 cents a share
Sales rose 9 % to 2.57 billion from 2.36 billion
For the nine months the company posted a 14 % rise in profit to 469.8 million or 2.21 a share from 410.3 million or 1.95 a share
Sales rose 9 % to 7.54 billion from 6.95 billion
Results for the 1989 third quarter and nine months include a pretax loss of 33 million from the company 's business improvement and refocusing program and a gain of 49 million on the sale of a subsidiary 's common stock
Forest-products operations strengthened in the third quarter while paper operations were dogged by higher costs soft newsprint exports and a strong Japanese yen
Some competing forest-products firms have recently reported improved results due to strong pulp and paper business
Weyerhaeuser 's pulp and paper operations were up for the nine months but full-year performance depends on the balance of operating and maintenance costs plus pricing of certain products the company said
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter the company said export log and lumber markets will be weak while panel and plywood markets will be stronger
Pulp and paper performance depends on cost and price variables the company said
Bankers Trust New York Corp. became the latest major U.S. bank to increase reserves for its loans to less-developed countries making a 1.6 billion third-quarter addition to its provision
The bank also said it expects to report a 1.42 billion loss for the third quarter and a loss for the full year
The new reserves bring the company 's provision for loans to Third World countries to 2.6 billion or 85 % of Bankers Trust 's medium and long-term loans to these countries
Step up to the plate and take the big swing
Get the problem behind you and do n't look back said James J. McDermott analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods in approving of the move
Bankers Trust has had the capacity to do this for some time the analyst said
He expects Citicorp to take a similar step this year
Citicorp yesterday reported a 9 % third-quarter earnings drop which analysts called a bit disappointing while Manufacturers Hanover Corp. posted a 789 million loss for the quarter after adding 950 million to its reserve for loans to less-developed countries
Three other major U.S. banks posted earnings increases
Wells Fargo & Co. of San Francisco posted a 17 % jump
PNC Financial Corp. the parent of Pittsburgh National Bank reported net income climbed 9.8 % while net for Banc One Corp. of Columbus Ohio grew 3.8 %
Citicorp Analysts were only slightly disappointed by Citicorp 's numbers
There 's nothing in here that 's horrible and nothing to make you think they 're setting the world on fire said Carole Berger analyst for C.J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell Inc
Earnings from the bank 's global consumer business grew 27 %
The consumer business continues to drive the earnings stream said Mr. McDermott of Keefe Bruyette & Woods
Corporate finance and trading results in member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were relatively flat sometimes choppy the bank said and profit for the area sank 27 %
The cross-border loan portfolio reflected adjustment problems and episodic payment patterns the bank said no interest payments from Argentina in the nine months and none from Brazil in the third quarter while Venezuela brought itself substantially current
Overall the portfolio narrowed its quarterly loss to 70 million from 80 million a year earlier
People were waiting to see if we would take an additional provision for medium-term and long-term loans to less-developed countries a Citicorp spokesman said
But he reiterated the bank 's position that it is comfortable with the current level of 2.6 billion covering about 30 % of the 8.9 billion of such loans outstanding
Ronald I. Mandle analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. called Citicorp 's venture-capital gains of 93 million before taxes strong
A concerning item the analyst cited was the 10 % jump in expenses which the bank attributes to costs of expanding both its consumer credit-card operations and its overseas branch business
Citicorp 's spokesman said however that the bank is maintaining those expenses in proportion to revenue growth
Wells Fargo Wells Fargo continued to generate one of the highest profit margins among major banks minimizing a drop in net interest margin with 13 % third-quarter growth in high-yielding business loans and similar growth in mortgages
Its margin fell only seven basis points or 7\/100ths of a percentage point from a year ago compared with a 13-point drop at Security Pacific Corp. and much larger declines among banks in other parts of the country
As a result Wells Fargo 's net interest income rose 36.3 million or 7 % to 537 million for the quarter
Non-interest income fell slightly to 191.9 million from 193.3 million while Wells Fargo continued to rigorously control non-interest expense which was almost flat at 393.4 million
The combination of solid loan growth with tight expense control gave Wells Fargo a 1.25 % return on average assets for the quarter about 40 % higher than Security Pacific 's and a profit ratio matched by only two or three other major banks in the U.S.
Wells Fargo 's return on equity increased to 24.4 % from 23.8 %
Wells Fargo has sold all of its non-trade loans made to less-developed countries and managed to partly reverse the sharp rise in domestic non-accrual loans which fell 8 % from the previous quarter to 806.8 million from 880.9 million
But the amount was still 39 % higher than the year-ago level and 25 % higher as a percentage of total loans
That trend and Wells Fargo 's heavy exposure to leveraged buy-outs are about the only worries analysts have about Wells Fargo 's financial picture
Wells Fargo is rebuilding its loan-loss reserve which increased to 711 million at Sept. 30 from 664 million the previous quarter but was down from 852 million a year ago when the bank still had some shaky foreign loans
Manufacturers Hanover Manufacturers Hanover said that excluding the addition to its reserves certain tax benefits and a one-time 16 million gain on the sale of an interest in a foreign leasing company third-quarter earnings were 75 million
The comparable year-earlier number was 56 million a spokesman said
The bank 's additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less-developed countries to 2.4 billion covering 36 % of its medium and long-term loans outstanding to these nations
The net interest margin the difference between the bank 's cost of funds and what it receives as interest payments improved in the quarter as did certain areas of wholesale banking
Fees from syndicating loans dropped 48 % to 21 million
We did n't take part in a lot of deals in the quarter because their credit quality was poor the spokesman said
Expenses unrelated to interest rose 5.4 % to 541 million
PNC Financial PNC Financial cited higher income from sources unrelated to interest and said it continues to cut costs
Net interest income in the third quarter edged up 1.4 % to 317.7 million
Trust income grew 15 % to 49.9 million while service charges fees and commissions increased 22 % to 79.4 million
The bank 's total allowance for credit losses was 502.1 million or 1.82 % of total loans
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi set a date next month for general elections that some analysts say could cost him and his ruling Congress I Party control of the government
Other analysts say the Indian leader could retain control with a slim majority or be forced to rule as the dominant partner in a coalition with other parties
Elections in this large diverse and passionate nation are always hard to predict
Much depends on the opposition a loose group of regional and ideological parties led by former Gandhi cabinet minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh
The biggest certainty is that the elections will be a vote for or against Mr. Gandhi and his five years in power five years of ups and downs promises and disappointments and wide fluctuations in popularity
Yesterday four days after an unusual parliamentary defeat for the ruling party Mr. Gandhi called elections for the lower house of Parliament on Nov. 22 and 24
The elections will be held in different states on one of the two days
The lower house 's five-year term expires in January the Parliament 's upper house is appointed
The elections will be a rigorous test for the 45-year-old prime minister and Congress I which in various forms has ruled for 40 of India 's 42 years of independence
After a landslide win in 1984 in polls held after the assassination of his mother Indira Gandhi Mr. Gandhi saw his popularity begin a roller coaster ride
His early promises to make India a modern nation remain bogged down in bloated bureaucracy
His pledge to clean up local administration and Indian politics including his own party went unfulfilled
His Mr. Clean image was muddied by an arms-kickback scandal which will be a major campaign issue
Some analysts predict that disappointment in Mr. Gandhi 's spent pledge to reduce corruption and heavy-handed local government will crest at the polls
There 's a wide feeling of indignation across the country says Bhabani Sen Gupta of the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi
I think the people will be judging the regime by a petty policeman by a corrupt revenue collector
This could be a big protest against an administrative failure
Even if the Congress I retains control of the government Mr. Gandhi 's ability to push through major initiatives might be hobbled by a thinner majority
Economic analysts call his trail-blazing liberalization of the Indian economy incomplete and many are hoping for major new liberalizations if he is returned firmly to power
The Lok Sabha or lower house of Parliament has 542 elected and two appointed seats
In 1984 the Congress I captured 405 seats the largest victory in the history of Indian democracy
The landslide was fueled by panic that prevailed in India at the time
Mrs. Gandhi had been assassinated by separatist Sikhs and many Indians feared their country might split apart
In the previous three general elections similar national issues clinched the vote
In 1971 the Congress Party won after India 's victory in the Bangladesh war
In 1977 Mrs. Gandhi was thrown out of office after her 19-month emergency rule and in 1980 after her successors made a mess of their three years in power she was restored to office
Most political analysts say that if Mr. Gandhi 's opposition unites to field single candidates in most precincts the Congress I will lose big
But if the opposition remains fractured the Congress I could win a small majority or lead a coalition government
Chimanbhai Mehta a parliamentarian and former Gandhi ally predicts Congress I will win only 150 seats a quarter of the house if the opposition fields single candidates in 80 % of the races
Analysts say the opposition will struggle this week to unite and its success will be clear only when it announces its final list of parliamentary candidates
The arms-kickback scandal is likely to be one of the big talking points in the campaign but it 's unclear how it is viewed by average Indian voters
In 1986 India signed a 1.4 billion contract with AB Bofors a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden AB to purchase 400 artillery pieces
The contract was negotiated by the countries ' two prime ministers and was supposed to be free of commissions or agents ' costs
In April 1987 evidence surfaced that commissions were paid
The opposition charged that the money was used to bribe Indian government officials an allegation denied by Mr. Gandhi 's administration
But many of his statements on the issue in Parliament subsequently were proven wrong by documentary evidence
The scandal has faded and flared but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages and that has helped galvanize the opposition which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills
It was the first time in 20 years that such government bills were defeated
In a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone a job and even into a school the name Bofors has become a potent rallying cry against the government
That illustrates the kind of disappointment many Indians feel toward Mr. Gandhi whom they zestfully elected and enthusiastically supported in his first two years in power
His term has produced no spectacular failures in politics in the economy or on the military front and has chalked up some successes
But the average Indian had tremendous hope in the youthful leader and his promise to make both government and the ruling party more effective and less corrupt
His failures in those two areas deeply and sometimes bitterly disappointed many Indians
We do n't like the Congress I says Sooraji Jath a farmer in the western state of Gujarat
The Congress government is taking the farmers ' bread and not giving us any support
When there are well problems light problems road problems the government tells us to forget it
The greatest thing going for Mr. Gandhi and the Congress I Party is the poor reputation of the opposition
Even if it unites for the elections its coherence is likely to be temporary
When the Congress I lost the 1977 election following Mrs. Gandhi 's hated emergency rule a similar coalition took power and then disintegrated
Many Indians fear a repeat of that experience
March 24 1986 AB Bofors a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden AB enters into a 1.4 billion contract with India 's Defense Ministry to supply 400 Bofors FH-77B 155-mm field howitzer guns
In 1985 Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in his talks with then Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme imposed the condition that the contract have no middlemen
April 16 1987 Swedish National Radio reports that about 40 million nearly 3 % of the total contract was paid by Bofors as commissions to middlemen
June 1 1987 Sweden 's National Audit Bureau releases its report confirming payment of about 40 million to unidentified Indians
The report says that investigations were severely hampered by lack of cooperation from Bofors
Bofors says it ca n't disclose the names of the middlemen because it would jeopardize industrial confidentiality
A portion of the report containing names of the middlemen is withheld by officials citing bank secrecy requirements
Aug. 6 1987 Prime Minister Gandhi tells the Indian Parliament neither I nor any member of my family has received any consideration in these transactions
That is the truth
Aug. 26 1987 Bofors admits payments of 41 million to middlemen
April 22 1988 The Hindu newspaper publishes facsimiles of bank documents for foreign-exchange remittances and letters between Bofors and certain private companies related to the sale of the guns to India
April 26 1988 A parliamentary investigative committee dominated by the Congress I Party concludes that there were no middlemen in the deal and no payment to any Indian individual or company
July 18 1989 The comptroller and auditor-general of India reports serious lapses in the government 's technical and financial evaluation of the Bofors deal
Sept. 15 1989 Retired army Chief of Staff Krishnaswami Sundarji discloses in an interview that he suggested in May 1987 that the government cancel the Bofors contract
According to Gen. Sundarji that would have forced Bofors to disclose the names of the middlemen who received kickbacks from the company
His recommendation was rejected by the government
Oct. 9. 1989 The Hindu newspaper publishes the withheld portion of the Swedish National Audit Bureau 's report
The disclosures state that commissions were paid by Bofors to an Indian agent of the arms company
Parsow Partnership Ltd. and Elkhorn Partners L.P. said they may seek proposals from third parties relating to a sale or restructuring of CACI International Inc
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Parsow and Elkhorn which together hold 8.685 % of CACI 's common shares said they think it is in the best interest of CACI stockholders that the company be sold
CACI based in Arlington Va. said it had n't seen the filing by Parsow and Elkhorn and therefore had no comment
The partnerships said they may seek board representation and they may seek the support of CACI 's board and other major shareholders in connection with their plans
According to the filing Parsow and Elkhorn are based in Elkhorn Neb. and are controlled by the same general partner Alan S. Parsow
Their combined stake consists of 880,500 CACI common shares including 86,500 shares bought in the past 60 days at 2.3125 to 2.4375 a share
Additional shares may be bought or sold in the open market in private transactions or otherwise depending on market conditions and other factors
The inverse trading relationship between bonds and stocks was interrupted yesterday as bonds fell despite a modest decline in stock prices
But bond investors continue to keep a close watch on the jittery stock market
In early trading investors were bidding bond prices higher as stocks tumbled and fears mounted that Friday 's stock market debacle would be repeated
But a partial recovery in the Dow Jones Industrial Average which had been down more than 60 points in midmorning dashed those expectations
Treasury bonds also were hurt late in the day by a 4 billion offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the prospect of a huge amount of new agency debt
Bond investors were hoping that stock prices would continue to fall said Roger Early a vice president at Federated Investors Inc. Pittsburgh
When stocks stabilized that was a disappointment
Meanwhile for the second straight day the bond market paid little attention to the Federal Reserve 's open market operations
Fed officials injected more cash into the banking system by arranging 1.5 billion of repurchase agreements during the usual pre-noon intervention period
The move was meant to keep a lid on interest rates and to boost investor confidence
The intervention has been friendly meaning that they really did n't have to do it said Maria Fiorini Ramirez money-market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc
She said a more aggressive move was n't needed
The Fed also appears reluctant to ease credit conditions further
It already has allowed the closely watched federal funds rate to decline 1\/4 percentage point to about 8 3\/4 % from its previous target level of about 9 %
The rate which banks charge each other on overnight loans is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy
It ended at about 8 11\/16 % yesterday but was as low as 8 1\/2 % Monday
The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond fell more than 1\/2 point or over 5 for each 1,000 face amount while the yield moved above 8 % for the first time since Thursday
Investment-grade corporate municipal and mortgage-backed securities also fell
But most junk bonds closed unchanged after opening slightly higher on bargain-hunting by institutional investors
Some so-called high-quality junk issues such as R.H. Macy & Co. 's 14 1\/2 % subordinated debentures rose
The Macy 's issue closed up about one point at a bid price of 97
The TVA 's public debt offering was its first in 15 years
Strong investor demand prompted it to boost the size of the issue from 3 billion
Traders said hedging related to the TVA pricing also pressured Treasury bonds
Underwriters of the TVA bonds reduced their market risk by selling Treasurys to cover at least part of their TVA holdings said James R. Capra a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc
The TVA bonds also served to remind the market that there will be even more new supply said Lawrence N. Leuzzi a managing director at S.G. Warburg Securities & Co
Today the Treasury will announce the size of its next two-year note sale and Resolution Funding Corp. will announce details of its first bond offering
Some traders estimate 9.75 billion of new two-year Treasurys will be sold next week and they expect Refcorp to offer 4 billion to 6 billion of long-term bailout bonds
Refcorp was created to help fund the thrift bailout
Another agency issue came to market yesterday
The Office of Finance of the Federal Home Loan Banks said it priced a four-part 2.27 billion bond offering for the banks to yield from 8.125 % to 8.375 %
The release of several economic reports had little impact on the market including a report that the U.S. trade deficit expanded to a surprisingly wide 10.77 billion in August up from a revised 8.24 billion in July
The August gap was expected to have expanded to 9.1 billion
Treasury Securities Treasury securities were essentially flat to about 1\/2 point lower
The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 100 28\/32 to yield 8.04 % compared with 101 19\/32 to yield 7.97 % Monday
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 99 25\/32 to yield 8.01 % compared with 100 1\/32 to yield 7.97 %
Short-term rates increased
The discount rate on three-month bills rose to 7.52 % for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.75 %
The rate on six-month bills rose to 7.53 % for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.92 %
Corporate Other Issues Investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1\/4 to 1\/2 point lower while most junk bonds ended unchanged
The TVA 's huge 4 billion offering dominated attention in the new-issue market
TVA offered 2 billion of 30-year bonds priced to yield 9.06 % 1 billion in 10-year notes priced to yield 8.42 % and 1 billion in five-year notes priced to yield 8.33 %
The TVA which operates one of the nation 's largest electric power systems is a corporation wholly owned by the U.S. government
Yesterday 's bond sale was part of a 6.7 billion refinancing plan to pay off high-interest debt the TVA owes the Federal Financing Bank an arm of the Treasury
Meanwhile Lockheed Corp. priced a 300 million note offering to yield 9.39 %
Mortgage-Backed Securities The derivative mortgage-backed market revived after a brief hiatus as two new Remics totaling 850 million were offered and talk circulated about two more issues that could be priced today
The revival of the real estate mortgage investment conduit market reflected the relative calm in the mortgage market after two days of volatile trading
Dealers noted that it 's difficult to structure new Remics when prices are moving widely
The two Remics priced were a 500 million Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. issue underwritten by Salomon Brothers Inc. and a 350 million Federal National Mortgage Association deal underwritten by Greenwich Capital Markets
The Remic issuance supported prices of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securities which held up better than Government National Mortgage Association securities during an afternoon sell-off
Ginnie Mae 9 % securities for November delivery ended at 97 29\/32 down 7\/32 9 1\/2 % securities at 99 31\/32 down 6\/32 and 10 % securities at 101 29\/32 down 5\/32
Freddie Mac 9 % securities were at 97 5\/32 down 3\/32
The Ginnie Mae 9 % issue was yielding 9.43 % to a 12-year average life assumption as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note held at 1.42 percentage points
Municipals Confusion over the near-term trend for rates dominated the municipal arena as gyrations in the stock market continued to buffet bonds
Long tax-exempt dollar bonds were mostly flat to 3\/8 point lower after a whipsaw session of moving inversely to stocks in modest dealer-led trading
Prices of pre-refunded municipal bonds were capped by news that Chemical Securities Inc. as agent for a customer will accept bids today for two large lists of bonds that include many such issues
The lists total 654.5 million
Pre-refunded bonds are called at their earliest call date with the escrowed proceeds of another bond issue
Meanwhile several new issues were priced
Underwriters led by PaineWebber Inc. set preliminary pricing for 144.4 million of California Health Facilities Financing Authority revenue bonds for Kaiser Permanente
Tentative reoffering yields were set from 6.25 % in 1993 to 7.227 % in 2018
As part of its College Savings Plan Connecticut offered 100.4 million of general obligation capital appreciation bonds priced to yield to maturity from 6.25 % in 1994 to 6.90 % in 2006 2007 and 2009
A Chemical Securities group won a 100 million Oregon general obligation veterans ' tax note issue due Nov. 1 1990
The 6 3\/4 % notes yield 6.25 %
Foreign Bonds West German government bond prices took a wild roller-coaster ride pulled down by Monday 's U.S. stock market gains then up by a wider-than-expected U.S. trade deficit and falling U.S. stock prices
West Germany 's 7 % bond due October 1999 was at 99.95 late yesterday off 0.10 point from Monday to yield 7.01 %
The 6 3\/4 % notes due April 1994 were up 0.10 point to 97.85 to yield 7.31 %
British government bonds surged on renewed volatility in the stock market
The Treasury 11 3\/4 % bond due 2003\/2007 rose 23\/32 to 112 10\/32 to yield 10.03 %
But Japanese bonds ended weaker
The benchmark No. 111 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended on brokers ' screens at a price of 96 off 0.15 point to yield 5.27 %
A House-Senate conference approved an estimated 67 billion fiscal 1990 spending bill that provides a 28 % increase for space research and development and incorporates far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market
The current ceiling on home loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration would be increased to 124,875
Separately the bill gives authority to the Bush administration to facilitate the refinancing of federally subsidized loans for low-income and moderate-income homeowners
The second provision affecting so-called 235 mortgages has met strong opposition from investment bankers represented by the Public Securities Association
And a squad of influential former Senate aides employed by the Wall Street firm Salomon Brothers came to the Capitol in a vain attempt to strip the provision
By an 11-2 margin Senate negotiators voted to preserve the 235 mortgage refinancing plan and despite powerful allies the opposition found itself undercut by an unusual alliance of liberals and conservatives
The government currently is subsidizing an estimated 23,000 loans above 11 % under the 235 program and however disruptive to private investors the refinancing is expected to yield at least 15 million in savings in fiscal 1990
This sum has been guarded jealously by appropriators anxious to offset spending elsewhere and conservative Sen. Phil Gramm cast the fight as a populist stand against monied interests
We are stewards here not of the mortgage companies but the taxpayers said the Texas Republican
The action came as the administration won final congressional approval of 9 million in assistance for elections scheduled in Nicaragua in February
The bulk of the money would be funneled through the National Endowment for Democracy but the legislation is so vaguely written that it has been dogged by questions regarding the money 's true purpose and its ultimate destination
The Senate had refused late Friday to invoke cloture and limit debate but behind the bipartisan leadership a solid majority took shape yesterday and brushed aside amendments seeking to cut the total package or steer it away from direct aid to political parties
Final approval on a 64-35 roll call was never in doubt but the opposition drew an unusual mix of senators including Republicans Jesse Helms and Warren Rudman and Democrats Bill Bradley and John Glenn
The money will be applied for voter registration and election monitoring but more than half is likely to go to the Union Nacional Opositora party
Critics warned such cash contributions may only undercut the opposition party 's standing and one irony is that under Nicaraguan law a major portion of the opposition party 's funds must be shared with the government 's Supreme Electoral Council
Within the appropriations conference yesterday the 67 billion measure is the second largest of the annual domestic spending bills and covers a disparate collection of accounts for science housing veterans and the environment
The decision to raise the ceiling on FHA home loans still faces strong opposition in the House
But it is driven by the same fiscal pressures that have forced lawmakers to resort to various bookkeeping devices to juggle as much as 1 billion in spending that would otherwise put the bill over budget
These costs will complicate the budget picture in fiscal 1991 and the measure further commits Congress to a set of costly projects including the first construction funds for the space station
The station is promised 1.8 billion within the 5.36 billion provided for research and development in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the nation 's high-speed aerospace plane cut by the Senate could receive as much as 60 million in new funds or transfers
Similarly the House agreed to add back 62 million to continue work on the advanced communications technology satellite being developed by General Electric Co
And while setting a statutory limit of 1.6 billion on the automated space probe the conference appropriated 30 million for the start-up of the CRAF-Cassini mission a successor to the Voyager space probe
Among major domestic agencies the Environmental Protection Agency stands to receive increases significantly beyond those sought by the administration with pollution abatement and control accounts growing by 14 % to about 829.9 million
An estimated 1.57 billion is separately allocated for the National Science Foundation and within the Housing and Urban Development Department more than 9.2 billion is provided for federally assisted housing including an expanded effort to modernize public housing units that serve the poorest families
To an unusual degree the massive bill has become a vehicle for lawmakers to earmark funds for projects in home states
While the practice was discouraged in the past the conference agreement is laced with veterans ' hospitals environmental projects and urban grants designated for specific communities
The most striking example yesterday may have been in community development funds where the two houses had separately approved a total of 27 projects valued at 20 million and the conference added 15 more valued at 8 million to ostensibly preserve balance between the House and Senate
Yesterday 's conference agreement is the second major bill to emerge from negotiations this week as appropriators approved a fiscal 1990 transportation bill late Monday that includes a sweeping ban on smoking on most domestic airline flights
An exemption will remain for flights longer than six hours to Hawaii and Alaska but estimates by the tobacco industry yesterday indicate all but about 30 flights would be covered
Separately a third conference report covering an 18.4 billion Treasury and Postal Service bill was sent to the Senate after passing the House on a 383-30 roll call yesterday
And after weeks of delay the appropriations process is beginning to take some final shape
Defense and foreign aid are the two most critical areas remaining from the administration 's standpoint
And among domestic programs the most serious threat is White House opposition to abortion riders attached to separate bills funding the District of Columbia and Department of Health and Human Services
The same issue threatens to spill over to the foreign aid debate and Mr. Bush also is threatening to veto any agreement that preserves Senate-passed provisions renewing U.S. support for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities
In a sharply written letter Rep. David Obey chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee for foreign operations warned Mr. Bush that the result of his ultimatum could weaken efforts to accommodate the administration elsewhere
As a result of your ultimatum writes the Wisconsin Democrat I guess there is no longer any point in taking administration views into account on other items in conference inasmuch regardless of their resolution you apparently intend to veto this bill
Markets usually get noticed because they soar or plunge
Gold which has n't risen or fallen significantly in quite some time yesterday achieved what may be a new level of impassiveness The most actively traded futures contracts closed unchanged despite nervous fluctuations in both the dollar and the stock market
The settlement prices of the December February and April gold contracts were even with Monday 's final prices
The December 1989 contract which has the greatest trading volume ended at 371.20 an ounce
The other months posted advances of 10 cents to 20 cents an ounce
According to one analyst Bernard Savaiko of PaineWebber New York the stock market 's ability on Monday to rally from last Friday 's decline which seemed to indicate that the economy was n't going to fall either took the starch out of precious metals prices and out of gold 's in particular
Yesterday gold traded within a narrow range
Gold tried to rally on Monday but ran into the same situation that has subdued gold prices for more than a year selling by gold producers who want to fix the highest possible price for their gold
December delivery gold is trading in a range of 365 to 375 an ounce and is having difficulty breaking out above that Mr. Savaiko said
Producers at the moment regard that area a good one in which to sell gold
Also Mr. Savaiko noted stock market investors seeking greater safety are veering toward buying bonds rather than precious metals because we are tending more toward a disinflationary economy that does n't make gold and precious metals attractive
Jeffrey Nichols president of APMS Canada Toronto precious metals advisers said there is little to motivate gold traders to buy the metal
Investors in the U.S. and Europe are comfortable with the actions of the Federal Reserve in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial system which helped the stock market rebound on Monday he said
There is n't any rush on the part of investors in the West to buy gold he said
They still bear the memory of October 1987 when they bought gold after the stock market crashed and ended up losing money because gold prices subsequently fell Mr. Nichols said
It 's an experience they do n't want to repeat
At the moment gold traders are n't concerned about inflation he said and as for the dollar gold 's association with the currency has been diminishing recently so drops in the currency are n't having much impact on gold
Dinsa Mehta chief bullion trader for Chase Manhattan Bank said There is little incentive on the part of traders to sell gold because the stock market may go lower and gold may retain some of its flight to safety ' quality
There is little incentive to buy gold because if the stock market goes higher it may be just a false alarm
This is keeping the gold traders handcuffed
The most remarkable feature about yesterday 's action was that the price of roughly 370 an ounce was regarded as attractive enough by gold producers around the world to aggressively sell gold Mr. Mehta said
I do n't know what it means over the long run but for the short term it appears that gold producers are grateful for the 10 or so that gold has risen over the past week or so he said
Previously he noted gold producers tended to back off from a rising gold market letting prices rise as much as possible before selling
Mr. Mehta observed that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit which rose sharply in August according to yesterday 's report has been having less and less impact on the gold market
The dollar has n't reacted much to it so gold has n't either he said
In other commodity markets yesterday ENERGY Crude oil prices rose slightly in lackluster activity as traders in the pits tried to assess action in the stock market
Since stock market indexes plummeted last Friday participants in all markets have been wary
When traders become confident that the stock market has stabilized oil prices are expected to rise as supply and demand fundamentals once again become the major consideration
Crude oil for November delivery edged up by 16 cents a barrel to 20.75 a barrel
Heating oil prices also rose
November gasoline slipped slightly
SUGAR Futures prices rose on a report that Cuba may seek to postpone some sugar shipments
The March contract advanced 0.14 cent a pound to 14.11 cents
According to an analyst Cuba ca n't meet all its shipment commitments and has asked Japan to accept a delay of shipments scheduled for later this year into early next year
Japan is perceived as a wealthy nation that can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the sugar the analyst said
It was the possibility of this demand that helped firm prices the analyst said
Another analyst noted that Cuba has been deferring shipments in recent years
To the professionals in the trade it did n't cause much surprise
The March futures contract traded as high as 14.24 cents but could n't sustain the advance he said
LIVESTOCK AND MEATS The prices of cattle hogs and pork belly futures contracts rebounded as livestock traders shook off fears that the Friday stock market plunge would chill consumer spending which in turn would hurt retail sales of beef and pork
The prices of most livestock futures contracts had dropped sharply Monday
Cattle futures prices were also supported yesterday by signs that supermarket chains are making plans to increase their promotions concerning beef
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS The prices of most soybean and soybean-meal futures contracts rose amid rumors that the Soviet Union is interested in buying from the U.S. or South America about 250,000 metric tons of soybeans and as many as 400,000 metric tons of soybean meal
Traders are especially sensitive to reports of possible U.S. soybean sales because U.S. exports are lagging
Since Sept. 1 about 13 million fewer bushels of U.S. soybeans have been sold overseas than for the same period last year
Corn futures prices rose slightly while wheat prices settled mixed
Moody 's Investors Service Inc. fretting about increasing competitive pressure on Ryder placed about 2.8 billion in company securities under review for possible downgrade
Ratings under review are Ryder 's A-1 collateral trust debentures A-2 senior notes and bonds A-2 preferred stock and the company 's Prime-1 rating for commercial paper
Moody 's said it is assessing the strategies Ryder 's management may follow in addressing significant challenges in some major markets
The rating agency said it is focusing especially on the transportation service company 's efforts to control costs improve margins and enhance its competitive position in its primary business vehicle leasing and rental
The nations of southern Africa know a lot about managing elephants their herds are thriving
But the nations of Europe and North America have decided they know better
At this week 's U.N. conference in Lausanne they imposed a global ivory ban that seeks to overturn local policies
A Zimbabwean delegate argued that the ban would guarantee the extinction of the elephant
Legitimate ranchers who have an interest in preserving the herds would go out of business
Poachers would control the underground trade
Many delegates were willing to craft a compromise but U.S. delegate Constance Harriman and others thundered that down
The Greens from the First World wanted a morality play not a negotiation
Fortunately the nations of southern Africa have n't totally surrendered their sovereignty
Five countries announced they would not honor what one Zimbabwean delegate wryly called the made in Switzerland solution
In fact they seemed a mite resentful
The director of Zimbabwe 's Wildlife Department described American conservationists as fat little puppies from urban environments who do n't know a thing about Africa
That 's not fair they 're not all fat
HUGO'S BLAST generates pleas for aid from South Carolina small businesses
The Small Business Administration has received more than 5,000 formal requests for disaster loans because of the hurricane
About 45 % of requests for SBA relief loans which also are available to homeowners come from small businesses compared with a 25 % business share after most disasters
The SBA expects to make about 1 billion in Hurricane Hugo loans
The disaster fund is replenished by loan repayments
Hardest hit by Hugo in South Carolina were small retailers tied to the tourist industry and businesses in agriculture and cultivated seafood
The State Development Board set up a Hugo Hotline to accept business-to-business help
After NBC weather man Willard Scott broadcast the hot-line number it was flooded with 10,000 calls
Last week the U.S. Chamber of Commerce began using its national TV show to seek help such as equipment for business owners
Local bankers and accountants help applicants fill out forms
It helps us and people feel better talking to someone who 's gone through the same thing an SBA official says
HEALTH BENEFITS remain a central lobbying effort even as Section 89 fades
The Senate after deleting Section 89 repeal from its deficit-reduction bill still is expected to join the House in voting to kill the law which forces companies to provide comparable benefits to laborers and executives alike
In lobbying on other health-coverage topics the National Federation of Independent Business will press for legislation that would give self-employed people a 100 % tax deduction for their own health plans up from 25 % currently
And the group will urge that the federal government pre-empt state rules on what must be covered by employers ' health insurance
Small-business groups also will fight the medical-leave provision of legislation that would expand parental leaves
And they still oppose as too costly an employer-paid health insurance bill sponsored by Sen. Edward Kennedy D. Mass
despite his proposal to phase in small business only gradually
There is also worry that the Pepper Commission studying long-term health care will again push lawmakers toward employerpaid solutions
The Section 89 victory could have a downside by making it harder to oppose lawmakers on other health proposals
With the repeal of Section 89 we can no longer say they 're discouraging businesses from offering health plans says Christine Russell the Chamber of Commerce 's small-business advocate
JUMPING THE GUN Sen. Lloyd Bentsen D. Texas was outraged after a private word to John Motley lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business resulted in a news release saying that the Senate Finance Committee chairman would recommend repeal of Section 89
Even though the announcement was true in the end it was issued without the senator 's permission
I blew it Mr. Motley says apologetically
It was a timing mistake
PRISON-SHOP BLUES Sen. Strom Thurmond R. S.C
protests pending legislation to end the preference that the federal prison system gets in selling prisoner-made furniture and other goods to government agencies
Small-business suppliers want prisons to stop getting high priority especially as prison production grows with swelling inmate populations
Last year the prisons ' sales to the Pentagon totaled 336 million
REPAIR SHOPS SCRAP for more access to work on auto-emissions systems
Groups representing some independent auto-repair shops join a compromise on the Clean Air legislation worked out between environmentalists and Rep. Henry Waxman D. Calif

The plan would increase the warranty on auto-emission systems to eight years or 80,000 miles from five years or 50,000 for major parts
But the warranty on simpler parts would be lowered to two years or 24,000 miles
The garage owners say they would benefit because car owners would be less likely to go back to dealers for the simpler repairs after two years
The repair shops are n't united however
Shops represented by the Automotive Service Industry Association and the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association oppose any increase in warranty length
They say the longer the warranty the longer customers will automatically return to new-car dealers which then find non-warranty work that might otherwise go to repair shops
The House Energy Committee will debate the issue later this month
Stan Hathcock an Atlanta garage owner who opposes a longer warranty estimates that the current plan costs him as much as 15,000 a year in lost business
SMALL TALK Some 70 % of graduates who recently earned an M.B.A. degree say they 'd prefer to work in or own a small company yet most take jobs with large concerns says a survey by the Foster McKay Group a New York recruiting firm
Cardinal Scientific Inc. of Waldorf Md. seeks a Small Business Innovation Research grant to produce a nozzle assembly for an Army mass delousing outfit
Banc One Corp. said Frank E. McKinney plans to retire as the bank holding company 's president effective Jan. 12
Banc One said it is contemplated that John B. McCoy chairman and chief executive officer will assume the additional position of president upon Mr. McKinney 's retirement
Mr. McKinney 50 years old was chairman and chief executive of American Fletcher Corp. Indianapolis when that bank holding company merged into Banc One in January 1987
The company said Mr. McKinney plans to retire because the process of affiliating American Fletcher into Banc One is considered completed
Mr. McKinney will continue as chairman of the board and chairman of the executive committee of Banc One Indiana Corp. the successor company to American Fletcher Corp. but will no longer be active in day-to-day management
He will remain on the Banc One board
The Treasury plans to raise 1.55 billion in new cash with the sale Monday of about 15.6 billion in short-term bills to redeem 14.1 billion in maturing bills
The offering will be divided evenly between 13-week and 26-week bills maturing on Jan. 25 1990 and April 26 1990 respectively
Tenders for the bills available in minimum 10,000 denominations must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Monday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches
Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered ratings on about 650 million of Beatrice Co. debt citing the closely held Chicago food concern 's proposed recapitalization
The ratings concern said it downgraded Beatrice notes Euronotes and certain industrial revenue bonds to single-B-1 from Ba-3 and the company 's subordinated debentures to single-B-3 from single-B-2
Moody 's said the proposed recaptilization may limit the company 's ability to realize its profit potential and that paying dividends from a new series of preferred could squeeze basic business operations
A Beatrice spokesman did n't return calls seeking comment
Beatrice which went private in an 8.2 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986 said last month that it might borrow again to help pay investors as much as 983 million in preferred stock and debt securities
When the Soviets announced their last soldier had left Afghanistan in February the voices of skepticism were all but drowned out by an international chorus of euphoria
It was the Soviets Vietnam
The Kabul regime would fall
Millions of refugees would rush home
A resistance government would walk into Kabul
Those who bought that illusion are now bewildered
Eight months after Gen. Boris Gromov walked across the bridge into the U.S.S.R. a Soviet-controlled regime remains in Kabul the refugees sit in their camps and the restoration of Afghan freedom seems as far off as ever
But there never was a chance that the Afghan resistance would overthrow the Kabul regime quickly and easily
Soviet leaders said they would support their Kabul clients by all means necessary and did
The U.S. said it would fully support the resistance and did n't
With the February 1987 U.N. accords relating to Afghanistan the Soviet Union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control
The terms of the Geneva accords leave Moscow free to provide its clients in Kabul with assistance of any kind including the return of Soviet ground forces while requiring the U.S. and Pakistan to cut off aid
The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last-minute addition of a unilateral American caveat that U.S. aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did
But as soon as the accords were signed American officials sharply reduced aid
In February 1989 when the Soviets said they had completed their pullout the U.S. cut it further
Not so the Soviets
Gen. Gromov himself said Soviet troops expected to leave behind more than 1 billion of military equipment and installations for the Kabul regime
Since the troop withdrawal Moscow has poured in an additional 200 to 300 million worth per month nearly 2 billion since February equivalent to the total U.S. aid to the resistance in nine years
This includes what Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov fetchingly called new peaceful long-range weapons including more than 800 SCUD missiles
By early May Moscow had delivered for example 1,000 trucks about 100 tanks artillery and hundreds of other combat vehicles
Later that month it added an entire tank brigade including 120 T-72 tanks and more than 40 BMP state-of-the-art infantry fighting vehicles
By September a new Reinforced Motorized Rifle Brigade with an additional 300 combat vehicles 1,000 more trucks and 10,000 Soviet-trained Afghan troops had arrived in Kandahar
In the last few weeks Moscow has added FROG-7B missiles the bomber version of the An-12 MiG-23BN high-altitude aircraft MiG-29s which can outfly Pakistan 's U.S.-built F16s and Sukhoi SU-27 fighter-bombers which can outfly the MiG-29s
Moscow claims this is all needed to protect the Kabul regime against the guerrilla resistance
It is well-known that the regular Afghan infantry is filled with reluctant conscripts
But this is not the entire Afghan army and it is no longer Kabul 's only military force
Complete units have been trained and indoctrinated in the U.S.S.R. and other East bloc nations 30,000 to 40,000 of these troops have returned
In addition the regime has established well-paid paramilitary forces totaling more than 100,000 including 35,000 Soviet-trained troops of the Interior Ministry KHAD\/WAD which still is directed by 1,500 Soviet KGB officers
Even if not all these forces are committed to the regime they are now dependent on it
And thousands of Afghan children have been taken to the Soviet Union where they are hostage for the behavior of their families
Since 1981 Indian military advisers have been assisting the Kabul regime
In preparation for the withdrawal Moscow Kabul and New Delhi signed two agreements for several hundred newly civilian Indian experts to replace some of the more visible Soviet military personnel
Cuban military personnel also have been active in Afghanistan since 1979
The Soviets cut a deal with Iran a future Iranian role in Afghanistan in exchange for Iranian support of Soviet policy
The deal was symbolized by the restoration of the Shi'ite Sultan Ali Keshtmand to the Afghan prime ministry
Moreover serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of Soviet forces
Before his assassination in 1988 President Zia of Pakistan repeatedly stated that fresh Soviet troops were being inserted into Afghanistan even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn
Rep. Bill McCollum R. Fla. reports that these included 20,000 to 30,000 Soviet Central Asian KGB Border Guards ethnically indistinguishable from Afghans and wearing unmarked uniforms
Meanwhile the Kabul regime is increasingly successful at portraying the resistance as bloody-minded fanatics
In this they are aided by years of American European Pakistani and Saudi support for the most extreme factions radical Islamic fanatics with leaders whose policies are anathema to the Afghan public
This heavy outside support for the worst has undermined better moderate leaders
In autumn last year for example the regime garrison at Kandahar was prepared to surrender the city to resistance moderates
At the last minute however Pakistani officials sent in Gulbuddin Hekhmatyar perhaps the most hated and feared of the extremists with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces
The deal fell through and Kandahar remains a major regime base
The resistance lacks not only air power armor and expertise but often such essentials as maps mine detectors or even winter gloves
Experienced resistance commanders wanted to use guerrilla action and siege tactics to wear down the regime
Instead they were pressured by Pakistan 's ISI the channel for their support into attacking Jalalabad
They took more than 25 % casualties journalists report that they faced minefields without mine detectors
The wonder is not that the resistance has failed to topple the Kabul regime but that it continues to exist and fight at all
Last summer in response to congressional criticism the State Department and the CIA said they had resumed military aid to the resistance months after it was cut off but it is not clear how much is being sent or when it will arrive
For months the resistance has been defenseless against air attack
Thus far there is no indication that they have been re-supplied with Stingers or other anti-aircraft weapons
Indeed U.S. officials have indicated to the press that the continuation of aid depends on what success the weakened resistance achieves by the end of this year
Moscow and Kabul must have found that information useful
For a decade U.S. policy has been incoherent based on miscalculation and the defense of bureaucratic and political turf
No settlement negotiated by others can force the Afghan people to give up their struggle
A cutoff of U.S. military aid would merely abandon them to die in vain
Creation of a new realistic U.S. policy is long overdue

Nothing stirred the soul of Ronald Reagan and his disciples as much as the crusade to aid Nicaragua 's Contra rebels or the dream of building a space-based defense shield to knock out Soviet nuclear missiles
Yet under Mr. Reagan 's preferred successor President Bush those two cherished national-security causes are withering on the vine
And surprisingly little more than a whimper of protest is being heard even though Reaganauts once breathed fire supporting the Contras and the Strategic Defense Initiative
The programs have arthritis says Rep. Henry Hyde a conservative Republican from Illinois
Yet he asserts you look around and you say Who are the leaders Who is going to carry the water It is n't surprising that President Bush has n't led a crusade to pump up the Contras or SDI
Though he nominally supports both programs Mr. Bush has n't been a passionate champion of either cause as Mr. Reagan was
What 's surprising is that there is n't more of a conservative outcry as the Bush administration lets the programs slip down the national-priority list
A combination of factors a weariness among some conservatives a decline in the perception of a Soviet threat and a preoccupation with other issues seem to explain the strange tranquility
Above all though conservative Republicans who have championed both the Contras and SDI are reluctant to attack a Republican president for failing to do more though that reluctance may be receding
We want to complain we want to say something about it and we 're going to as it gets worse says Rep. Dan Burton an Indiana Republican who has been a staunch Contra backer
But it 's like kicking your father in the pants
You hate to do it because he 's your father
Mr. Burton says conservatives ' unhappiness with Mr. Bush 's cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in Panama will make them more willing to speak out
Of course neither President Bush nor the Congress has actually abandoned the Contras or SDI
Mr. Bush has struck a deal with congressional leaders to provide nonlethal aid to the Contras until Nicaragua holds national elections next February
But the administration has dropped any effort to win military aid for the rebels
And the administration 's deal with Congress gives several congressional committees the right to cut off even humanitarian aid next month though the committees are likely to let aid continue until February
Most analysts think there 's little prospect the Contras can be a significant fighting force without U.S. arms and after the February election their future in any form will be murky at best
Instead of focusing on the Contras Mr. Bush has switched to urging members of Congress most recently in a White House meeting yesterday to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of Nicaragua 's Sandinista government
The administration continues to support SDI or Star Wars and it recently lobbied to persuade the Senate to restore some of the funds it planned to cut from the program
And just last week Defense Secretary Dick Cheney gave a strong speech listing compelling reasons to push ahead with SDI and saying he 'd urge President Bush to veto a defense bill with inadequate funding for the program
But the strong pitch by Mr. Cheney may be too little too late to prevent damage to SDI
The House has already voted for a deep cut in funding and in the end the program 's backers will be hard pressed to head off some reduction in spending next year
And while the defense secretary is speaking out President Bush himself has n't launched any high-visibility campaign to drum up support as President Reagan did
The administration also acknowledges that it is n't pursuing Mr. Reagan 's original vision of an impenetrable shield protecting the whole U.S. but rather a more modest version
More ominous to SDI supporters the Bush administration appears to have tacitly accepted a new arms-control proposal from the Soviet Union that spells long-term trouble for Star Wars
The Soviets have agreed to complete a treaty cutting strategic weapons without including restrictions on space-based defenses
But the Soviets also are insisting that they will reserve the right to withdraw from the completed strategic-arms treaty later on if the U.S. does SDI testing or deployment that the Soviets think violates the existing anti-ballistic-missile treaty
It will be hard down the road to persuade Congress to approve money for SDI plans if lawmakers fear those plans could scuttle a completed treaty
As a result Frank Gaffney a former Reagan Pentagon aide who now heads the Center for Security Policy charges that the administration 's professions of continued commitment to development and deployment of the SDI program strain credulity
Still proponents may be shying away from more drumbeating because they sense political tides have turned against arming the Nicaraguan rebels or boosting spending on SDI particularly when the public perceives the Soviet threat is declining under Mikhail Gorbachev
In fact because communism seems to be beating a global retreat some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their anti-communist philosophy is prevailing that they do n't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs
The short of it is that the most hard-bitten among us can not get into too sour a mood with communism collapsing says Mitchell Daniels a former Reagan White House aide who now is president of the Hudson Institute
Some activists are toiling to raise the profile of the two causes
But they say they ca n't make much headway because of a lack of willing leaders in a position to turn the tide
One longtime champion of these programs in Congress Republican whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia is distracted by questions about his ethics conservatives note
Other conservative champions like Wyoming Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop a longtime SDI advocate do n't have the clout with the Bush White House that they enjoyed with President Reagan
Above all though proponents say neither the Contra nor the SDI cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support
For there to be wind in the sails of any program the chief executive has to be blowing in the sails says Rep. Burton
All this causes Rep. Hyde to muse about an alternate way to drum up more enthusiasm
What I 'd like to see if he is up to it is for Reagan to take to the hustings to regenerate enthusiasm for SDI the congressman says
We 're sorry to report that on Monday President Bush accepted the resignation of William Allen as chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission
Mr. Allen appointed by President Reagan grew understandably tired of dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his enemies
His recent speech provocatively titled Blacks Animals Homosexuals What is a Minority caused an uproar when its title leaked out
Mr. Allen 's commissioners voted to call his unread speech thoughtless disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory
Commissioner Mary Francis Berry said it was another sad episode in the saga of the unguided missile who is chairman
Rep. Don Edwards the California Democrat warned Mr. Allen that the speech would be outside the scope of the commission 's jurisdiction
Thomas Stoddard head of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund called the prospect of the speech frankly shocking
We 've actually read the speech
Mr. Allen began it with a warning to his hosts a California church group that opposes rights for homosexuals
He said that other participants in the conference do not believe that the rights of Americans should be guaranteed to citizens who are homosexual but that I mean to persuade you to the opposite view
He recalled to the audience a strange infelicitous analogy he once heard arguing now that we have finally recognized that American blacks have rights we need to do the same for animals
Mr. Allen objected to this analogy because it seems to assimilate the status of blacks to that of animals as a mere project of charity of humaneness
Rights on such a basis whether for blacks or homosexuals are mere indulgences he said subject to being taken back
He says the title of his speech was to make his point that Americans have rights as individuals not as members of certain select groups
His speech criticized the idiocy of notions of protected groups in society as opposed to individual equality or as he put it in a common destiny as Americans
Instead of lobbying for special treatment Mr. Allen said that homosexuals and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special privileges that would risk invidious retrenchment with government complicity
This hardly sounds like an anti-homosexual screed
What 's really going on here The three most important things to understand about Mr. Allen is that he is a black conservative intellectual a triple threat to the liberal establishment
Mr. Allen who teaches government at prestigious Harvey Mudd College in California and will remain a member of the commission has spent years arguing that civil rights are individuals ' rights
He last made waves when he dared to defend an Indian girl who had been adopted by non-Indian parents off her reservation
Mr. Allen quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again which somehow elevated the vague concept of Indian rights above the rights of individual Indians
There is a huge divide between Mr. Allen 's we're-all-in-this-together view and the divisive litigation approach of the civil rights groups
Indeed the gap is so large that Mr. Allen 's critics refuse to engage the debate
Their ridicule of him is no substitute for argument
Their effort to run him out of Washington is an embarrassment to the original purpose of their own movement
We hope the next head of the Civil Rights Commission will be as brave as Mr. Allen in making the case for equality of civil rights
Bearings Inc. said its chairman John R. Cunin will retire as an officer of the company on Jan. 2
George L. LaMore president and chief executive officer will become chairman and chief executive upon Mr. Cunin 's retirement
John C. Dannemiller executive vice president and chief operating officer will become president and chief operating officer
Mr. Cunin 65 years old was chief executive of the distributor of bearings and power-transmission products from 1982 to 1988
He will continue as a director
Mr. LaMore 63 a 48-year veteran at Bearings has been president since 1983
Mr. Dannemiller 51 joined Bearings in August 1988 from Leaseway Transportation Corp. where he was president and chief operating officer
He has been a Bearings director since 1985
The appointments are part of a planned succession at the company
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev opened a major U.S. trade exhibition in Moscow and spent two hours touring some of the 150 stalls representing such blue-chip companies as General Motors Corp. International Business Machines Corp. and Johnson & Johnson
At the Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. stand Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller a board member offered him a soy burger
He did n't bite
The exhibition by the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council underscores the growing U.S. interest in that nation 's market though trade between the two countries is a minuscule 3 billion
The Soviet president and his prime minister Nikolai Ryzhkov spent the longest time about 15 minutes at the IBM stand where they got souvenir computer-chip key rings
At the GM stall they barely looked at a gleaming Cadillac preferring to talk about cooperation possibilities
In Beijing meantime China opened an international aviation show but the West 's embargo on military deals and uncertainty about the nation 's stability kept many foreign exhibitors away
Officials said 91 companies from 14 countries including the U.S. had displays down from about 260 firms from more than 20 countries at the last show in Japanese air-conditioner maker Daikin Industries Ltd. was fined two million yen 14,000 for exporting to the Soviet Union a chemical solution that could be used in missile-guidance systems
A Daikin executive in charge of exports when the high-purity halogenated hydrocarbon was sold to the Soviets in 1986 received a suspended 10-month jail sentence
Judge Masaaki Yoneyama told the Osaka District Court Daikin 's responsibility is heavy because illegal exports lowered international trust in Japan
Sale of the solution in concentrated form to Communist countries is prohibited by Japanese law and by international agreement
A Soviet legislative panel rejected as not radical enough a government proposal on decentralizing economic control
The newspaper Leninskoye Zamya said the committee decided the plan to parcel out economic powers previously exercised by Moscow to the country 's 15 republics does n't reflect the radical changes in the Soviet federation
The committee gave the government until Nov. 15 to revise the proposal
The move reflected the growing confidence of the revamped Supreme Soviet
Scott Paper Co. said it is abandoning a proposed 650 million tree-farming project in Indonesia because it no longer expects to use as much eucalyptus pulp as previously anticipated
The eucalyptus plantation and pulp mill which would have covered about 175,000 acres in the Irian Jaya region had been approved by Indonesia 's investment board
But it was opposed by some environmentalists as a threat to Irian Jaya 's forests and a potential source of social unrest for the primitive tribes who inhabit them
Yaohan Departmentstore Co. of Japan is moving its international-operations headquarters and holding company to Hong Kong to gain from the British colony 's economic advantages and tax structure
With funds of 5.56 billion Hong Kong dollars 712 million the new company Yaohan International Co. plans to acquire 10 of Hong Kong 's top restaurants
It also intends to set up an international wholesale market with the Singapore government next May and to open a department store in Bangkok and shopping centers in Malaysia Taiwan Canada Chicago and Seattle by December 1990
The chain currently has 90 retail outlets in Japan seven in the U.S. three in Hong Kong and a dozen more scattered around the globe
Major European auction houses are turning increasingly to specialized sales
Christie 's will soon have a sale of Dada and Symbolist art while Sotheby 's is luring collectors with sales of Swiss German Spanish Australian and Canadian paintings
In Brussels Hotel de Ventes Horta auctioned pistols and sabers along with paintings and jewels
Berlin 's Villa Grisebach will auction art works with pre-sale estimates of less than 1,600 on Nov. 25
The auction house known for its sales of top-drawer 19th and 20th century works is providing a service to clients who do n't want to sell just their fabulous oil paintings says Villa Grisebach 's Vivien Reuter
Antwerp auctioneer Campo is less concerned with market niches than with Belgium 's crushing tax and auction-fee burden
Everything has to be the same between countries says Campo 's Stefan Campo who is asking clients to sign protest petitions
Then there 'll be fair competition
Ending tax-free shopping in the European Community after 1992 could threaten more than 3,000 jobs the International Duty Free Confederation said
Instead of banning such shopping the confederation proposed amending controls to be sure the privilege is n't abused
British and Argentine diplomats opened talks in Madrid aimed at restoring ties severed because of their 1982 war over the Falkland Islands
Britain 's U.N. representative and delegation head Crispin Tickell called the first meeting good interesting and businesslike
Polaroid Corp. benefiting from staff-reduction savings reported a strong gain in third-quarter operating results and net income of 29.9 million or 40 cents a share after preferred-stock requirements
Analysts said the numbers were better than expectations partly because of strong profit margins and a positive foreign-currency translation
However they said the company 's flat revenue was a disappointment and an indication that sales of Polaroid 's new conventional film in the U.S. have been sluggish
Revenue in the third quarter was 437.7 million almost unchanged from 436.3 million a year earlier
Polaroid reported operating profit before taxes and interest costs of 63.1 million for the third quarter more than double the year-before 24 million
Charges for staff cuts and other restructuring produced a net loss of 54.1 million or 77 cents a share in 1988 's third quarter
I 'm somewhat skeptical about the underlying demand for Polaroid products said Michael Ellmann an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Co
If you believe that a good performance next year is contingent on an acceleration of revenue there is n't a lot here to base optimism on
Alex Henderson an analyst with Prudential-Bache says Polaroid officials told him yesterday that U.S. sales of the company 's new conventional film product introduced in the second quarter have been disappointing after a promising start
Sam Yanes a Polaroid spokesman said I do n't know about disappointing but added that the company has n't been able to get the product on the shelves of some mass-merchandise discount retailers that it had hoped would be carrying the product already
Mr. Yanes said the film One Film is currently carried at about 15,000 retail outlets including drugstores and supermarkets
For the nine months Polaroid reported earnings of 98.5 million or 1.27 a share
Last year the company had a nine-month loss of 15.1 million or 23 cents a share
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Polaroid closed at 47 up 1.125
Why is the stock market suddenly so volatile Yesterday the Dow Jones Industrial Average did a now familiar dance It plunged 60.25 points before lunch with most of the drop occurring in 25 minutes
Then it rebounded to finish down only 18.65 points
And those swings paled beside Friday 's 190.58-point plunge and Monday 's 88.12-point recovery
It 's madness that in an hour you can whack off so much value says Stanford Calderwood chairman of Trinity Investment Management Corp. Boston
And apparently it is here to stay
Richard Bernstein senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co says My gut feel is that we 'll live with those swings for a while
There are many reasons for the market 's jumpiness new trading vehicles such as stock-index futures and options computer-driven strategies like program trading and crowd psychology
But most are linked by a single theme liquidity the ability to get in and out of the market quickly
Prices are moving up and down so fast because investors are employing ways to turn over shares at ever-faster rates and increasingly acting in concert
Institutions are herding animals says Peter Anderson who heads the pension-fund management arm of IDS Financial Services Inc
We watch the same indicators and listen to the same prognosticators
Like lemmings we tend to move in the same direction at same time
And that naturally exacerbates price movements
Institutions who now account for most trading count on being able to buy and sell big blocks of stock at an eye-blink
But when they discover that markets are n't always as liquid as they supposed markets jump
On Monday for instance Howard Ward a principal at Scudder Stevens & Clark found that you could n't buy blue-chips at quoted prices without paying up
And when many firms had to pay up Monday 's sudden rally was sparked
Trading in futures and options some people believe can add to volatility
Investors believe they can can rely on such derivative securities to get in and out of the stock market without actually selling any stocks that is a way of staying liquid even when they own stocks
These and other modern trading methods tend to promote dramatic shifts in assets says George Douglas first vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc
It 's the idea that what goes in easy can come out easy so that bouts of higher volatility get built into the stock market
One new investment style called asset allocation shifts portfolio weightings between stocks bonds and cash when computer models say one is more attractive
For instance First Quadrant Corp. an asset allocator based in Morristown N.J. said it quickly boosted stock positions in its aggressive accounts to 75 % from 55 % to take advantage of plunging prices Friday
It added another 5 % Monday before stocks rallied
When they did the firm reduced those stock holdings to about 70 %
A classic example of institutions ' hunger for liquidity is portfolio insurance now widely discredited
Before the 1987 crash an estimated 60 billion in institutional money was managed under this hedging technique
The idea was to insure the value of a portfolio by selling futures when stock prices dropped eliminating the need to sell the stocks themselves
But in October 1987 when portfolio insurers rushed to sell at the same time they overwhelmed both the stock and futures markets
Yet even today institutions are quietly practicing forms of portfolio insurance by nervously rushing to and fro in the markets
Others are doing index arbitrage a strategy of taking advantage of price discrepancies between stocks and futures
Unlike traditional buy-and-hold strategies all of the above require that market makers be on hand to provide liquidity by buying and selling stocks in a crunch
But institutions say Wall Street brokerage firms are less willing to make markets
Brokers do n't deny that
Wall Street traders say that with institutional brokerage commissions far lower than in the 1970s securities firms ca n't afford to take the risk of buying too much stock
I think everyone 's a little more leery says Jack Baker head of equity trading at Shearon Lehman Hutton Inc
The institutions have driven commission rates down to the point where it makes no sense to commit capital says Tom Gallagher senior executive vice president in charge of institutional trading at Oppenheimer & Co
Why should I risk money for a guy for who 's paying me five cents a dance All you get is risk
Lack of liquidity can also result from exchange reforms
Many traders say that circuit breakers put in place to damp volatility after the 1987 crash actually added to volatility when the stock market plunged Friday
The circuit breakers caused a 30-minute shutdown in trading in Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures contract as the markets were falling
With the futures-trading halt you could only sell stocks to cut exposure to the market says a money manager
It was scary to people thinking that they could n't get their trades off
It was like they put you in a room with a gorilla and told you there were three doors to exit said one Chicago-based futures trader
Then they said By the way two of the doors are locked
The takeover mania also adds to volatility
UAL Corp. is a good example
Valued as a buy-out target the airline stock was trading at nearly 280 a share
When the deal ran into trouble the stock tumbled it closed at 198 yesterday
Presumably UAL is now trading closer to its value based on earnings
By contrast traditional buy-and-hold investors are unlikely to generate sudden price moves
Scott Black a value-oriented money manager who heads Delphi Management Inc. points out that for those who invest on fundamentals the value of a stock from day to day does n't change all that much
Some experts say markets are n't as volatile as widely assumed
Hans Stoll finance professor at Vanderbilt University says the current volatility in U.S. markets pales in comparison to the 1930s decades before derivative instruments such as options and futures were introduced
I just ca n't believe that the innovations in the financial market are causing any of this volatility he says
And Robert D. Arnott president of asset allocator First Quadrant notes that before Friday 's tailspin daily volatility on the New York Stock Exchange in recent weeks had reached historically low levels
Some people tend to ignore that a 50-point move is less in percentage terms than it was when the stock market was lower
John J. Phelan Jr. chairman of the Big Board asserts that 1988 and 1989 have been two of the least volatile years in the last 30 or 40 years
But the low average volatility Mr. Phelan is talking about is n't any comfort in a period of rapid stock-market moves like the past week
In addition Sanford Grossman a Wharton School finance professor says volatile jumps in stock prices will continue as long as liquidity falls short of the voracious demands of institutions who can go out and say I have a billion dollars of stocks to sell
Some people think the search for liquidity is fruitless
In 1936 John Maynard Keynes wrote that of the maxims of orthodox finance none surely is more antisocial than the fetish of liquidity
It leads investors to focus on short-term price movements a game of musical chairs he called it rather than on long-term fundamental valuation

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti-nuclear messages related to its Galileo space probe which is to be launched today
Charles Redmond a NASA spokesman said the agency discovered the virus on Monday on the collection of computer networks collectively called Internet and expected 100 university centers to be infected by today
Although the network is n't connected to the computer systems that operate either Galileo or the shuttle part of the network will carry analyses of Galileo data once the craft gets spaceborn
Mr. Redmond said the intruder had n't yet done any harm but the agency feared garbage data could be substituted for real data
He estimated it could take a day for a computer security manager to expunge the virus from a computer system
The intruder among the broadest yet to hit a research network appeared to affect only Digital Equipment Corp. hardware that uses Digital 's VAX\/VMS operating system
It is unrelated to the much-publicized virus that last year infected Arpanet a much larger network used by researchers at universities laboratories and government agencies around the world
In the lingo of computer security the NASA intruder is technically a computer worm Mr. Redmond said
A worm resides in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks
The Galileo worm apparently was hatched on a computer in France hooked up to NASA 's Space Physics Analysis Network Mr. Redmond said
NASA said the Galileo worm had n't affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had modified their systems to reject worms
But Mr. Redmond said the worm hit universities that had n't elected to make the changes
Michael Alexander a senior editor at Computerworld a trade publication said he was told that the worm gets into a computer center by looking for obvious passwords such as ones that are the same as the user 's name
If it finds one and gets into the system it will display a screen when a user logs on that says Worms Against Nuclear Killers
You talk of times of peace for all and then prepare for war
In addition Mr. Alexander said the worm sends strange messages to other machines at the center such as George Orwell was an optimist or Do n't feed the bats tonight
The worm also looks for elementary passwords that confer more privileges on the user
The passwords are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed to be replaced as soon as the system is up and running
If it finds one of those passwords Mr. Alexander said the worm will do such things as change users ' passwords to a series of random numbers preventing them from signing on to the network
NASA estimated that on Monday about four computer centers were affected
Yesterday the number grew to 40 today the number is expected to grow to 100
NASA said it will take about a week before it knows exactly how many centers of the 6,000 connected to Internet were affected and the extent of the damage if any
Anti-nuclear activists have protested the launch of the Galileo space probe to Jupiter because it uses plutonium to generate the electricity needed to run the craft
Activists fear that if the shuttle carrying Galileo into orbit should explode or if Galileo itself crashes into the Earth during the two times it flies close to the planet fatal levels of plutonium would be released into the atmosphere
So far Galileo has been delayed twice once because of a computer malfunction connected with a space-shuttle engine and yesterday because of the weather
NASA said the Galileo worm had nothing to do with either delay
Mr. Alexander of Computerworld said hackers have gone after SPAN before
He said the Chaos Computer Club of West Germany once managed to invade SPAN and do such things as change the value of pi messing up some calculations
It is now a commonplace that prosecutors are bringing criminal indictments in cases where until a few years ago only a civil action at most would have been brought
Yet it is also axiomatic that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature and not to courts
Beginning in the early 19th century with U.S. v. Hudson and Goodwin the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a judicial power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal while well established in British law would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers
That 's the conventional theory anyway
In practice however the line between interpretation and redefinition of the criminal law long ago began to blur
In particular a common law of white-collar crime has developed with surprising rapidity over the past decade
For example although insider trading has long been criminal it has never been statutorily defined
In 1983 the Supreme Court tried to supply a workable definition in the Dirks v. SEC decision which found that liability depended on whether the tipper had breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation in order to obtain some personal gain and whether the tippee knew or recklessly disregarded this fact
Gradually however lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point
Consider the facts underlying the 1989 conviction of Robert Chestman
Prior to a tender offer by A&P for Waldbaum Inc. in 1986 the founder of the Waldbaum 's supermarket chain called an elderly relative to tell her to assemble her stock certificates for delivery
She called her daughter to take her to the bank who in turn persuaded her husband a Mr. Loeb to run this errand
Hearing of this information the husband discussed it with his broker Mr. Chestman and Mr. Chestman then bought for his own account and other clients
Basically Mr. Chestman was a fourth-level tippee
Did Mr. Loeb his tipper breach a fiduciary duty and if so to whom Did Mr. Loeb seek personal gain and if so how Or did Mr. Chestman only hear a market rumor which one may lawfully trade upon The line seems awfully thin for criminal-law purposes
A second illustration is supplied by the recent guilty plea entered by Robert Freeman formerly head of arbitrage at Goldman Sachs & Co
Essentially Mr. Freeman had invested heavily in the Beatrice leveraged buy-out when he was told by another prominent trader Bernard Bunny Lasker that the deal was in trouble
After placing orders to sell Mr. Freeman called Martin Siegel an investment banker at Kidder Peabody & Co. who was advising on the deal to confirm these rumors
Mr. Siegel asked Mr. Freeman who his source was and on hearing that it was Bunny Lasker responded Well your bunny has a good nose
The illegal tip of the bunny 's good nose was then largely a confirmation of rumors already known to many in the market
Had the case gone to trial the same issues would have surfaced Was there a fiduciary breach in order to obtain personal gain Did Mr. Freeman have notice of this Finally was the information material Yet all these issues are subsidiary to a more central issue Who is and who should be making the criminal law here It is not my contention that either Mr. Chestman or Mr. Freeman was an innocent victim of prosecutorial overzealousness
Arguably both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky
But even if they behaved recklessly reasons still exist to fear and resist this steady process of case-by-case judicial extension of the law of insider trading
Courts and legislatures make decisions in very different ways and are each susceptible to very different kinds of errors
After-the-fact judicial examination of an actor 's conduct has always been the common law 's method
When only civil liability is involved this method has the undeniable strengths of factual specificity and avoidance of overgeneralization
Still case-by-case retrospective decision making of this sort is vulnerable to the tunnel vision caused by a fixation on ad hoc and usually sleazy examples
When a court decides that a particular actor 's conduct was culpable and so extends the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule
Thus a court is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule
For example in focusing on Mr. Freeman 's attempt to gain nonpublic information about a deal 's collapse one does not naturally think about the reverse side of the coin What if the rumor had been false Can a security analyst call an investment banker to make certain that a seemingly improbable rumor is in fact false In the past not only would reputable professionals have rushed to check out such rumors with the company but companies listed on the major stock exchanges were encouraged by the exchanges to respond openly to such inquiries from securities analysts
Today after Mr. Freeman 's plea there is an uncertainty that is both unfair and inefficient
In this light the comparative advantages of legislative law-making become clear 1 Before it acts the legislature typically will hear the views of representatives of all those affected by its decision not just the immediate parties before the court and 2 the legislature can frame bright line standards that create less uncertainty than the fact-bound decisions of courts
Although legislative lines can result in under-inclusion which explains why the SEC has long resisted a legislative definition of insider trading judicial lawmaking inevitably creates uncertainty because of the shadowy outer edges and implications of most judicial decisions
At least when the stakes are high uncertainty in turn results in overinclusion as individuals do not dare to approach an uncertain line closely
The federal mail and wire fraud statutes provide even better illustrations of the rapid evolution of a federal common law of white-collar crime
In 1987 the Supreme Court attempted in McNally v. U.S. to halt the inexorable expansion of these statutes by adopting a rule of strict construction for ambiguous criminal statues
Yet late last year Congress effectively reversed this decision by enacting a one-sentence statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services
At a stroke this may criminalize all fiduciary breaches and possibly all misrepresentations by an agent or employee
Such a statute illustrates the fundamental problem Congress finds it is easier to pass sweepingly moralistic prohibitions which the courts must thereafter interpret than to engage in the difficult line-drawing distinctions that are inherently its responsibility
We are confronted less with a judicial power grab than with a legislative giveaway
Predictably when confronted with morally dubious behavior prosecutors will exploit the latitude such openended statutes give them
Over the long run however sleazy cases will make bad law
Mr. Coffee is a professor at Columbia Law School
Corning Inc. posted a 38 % decline in third-quarter net income to 76.5 million or 80 cents a share from 123.9 million or 1.37 a share a year earlier
The year-earlier figure included a one-time gain of 59.9 million from the sale of Corning 's stakes in Japanese businesses
Without the gain operating profit was 64 million or 71 cents a share
The telecommunications specialty glass ceramic products and laboratory-services concern said the latest quarter included a tax-loss carry-forward of 600,000
A year earlier net included a 700,000 taxlow carry-forward
Sales rose 14 % to 715 million from 625.4 million
Corning 's chairman and chief executive officer James R. Houghton said operating performance continued to be strong in the telecommunications and health and science segments
But the specialty-material segment slowed somewhat and consumer products continued below expectations
As for joint ventures Mr. Houghton said profit was essentially flat due primarily to a slow recovery at Samsung-Corning Co. in Korea following a strike at a major customer and the disruption of shipments to China
Also profit was hurt by the strength of the dollar overseas which negatively affected the company 's currency-exchange rate
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Corning closed at 38.50 down 75 cents
UAL the hair-trigger stock that exploded Friday 's market bombshell briefly traumatized traders again yesterday

And they wo n't consider such a dividend the trust added before results are available for the first quarter of 1990
In part the trust cited the need to retain cash for possible acquisitions
According to a spokesman One Liberty will have paid out as dividends the required amount of its taxable income to maintain its legal status as a real estate investment trust
Banks are continuing to go after individual investors despite falling interest rates
Yields on small-denomination certificates of deposit fell at about half the rate of so-called jumbo CDs this week according to Banxquote Money Markets an information service based here
Investors can get slightly higher yields on deposits below 50,000 than they can on deposits of 90,000 and up
Banks want to remain competitive said Norberto Mehl chairman of Banxquote
October is a big rollover month and perhaps they anticipate greater demand among people leaving the stock market
Some bankers are reporting more inquiries than usual about CDs since Friday
Reports from branches are that there has been greater interest in the last day or so said Steven Braitman a vice president at Chemical Bank in New York
Chemical said deposits Monday were about 5 million higher than usual and it expects more activity as investors receive the proceeds from sales of stock
This is no time to be playing in the street the Dow has more ups and downs than an elevator proclaimed an advertisement Monday in New York newspapers touting Lincoln Savings Bank 's one-year CD
Harold Jones Lincoln 's chief retail banking officer said there has n't yet been a discernible response although the ad included a coupon that could arrive later in the week
Friday 's market rout came smack in the middle of the heaviest month for CD rollovers when a number of banks and thrifts already have promotions under way
First National Bank of Boston for example is offering certain new depositors an extra quarter of a percentage point on six-month and 12-month CDs
Some banks actually boosted yields on the shortest term CDs in the latest week
New York 's Citibank for instance increased the yield on small-denomination three-month CDs to 8 % from 7.9 %
On average however three-month CDs at major banks are yielding a tenth of a percentage point less than they were a week ago
Average yields on CDs aimed at individual investors fell less than half as much as yields on Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction
Six-month CDs of 50,000 and less yielded an average 8.02 % in the week ended Tuesday down from 8.10 % according to Banxquote
The yield on six-month T-bills fell to 7.82 % on Monday from 8.01 % the week before
Meanwhile the average yield on six-month CDs of more than 90,000 fell to 7.93 % in the latest week according to Banxquote from 8.10 % the week before
Mr. Mehl noted that actual rates are almost identical on small and large-denomination CDs but yields on CDs aimed at the individual investor are boosted by more frequent compounding
CDs sold by major brokerage houses which like jumbo CDs tend to closely follow interest rate trends also posted larger drops in yields
A six-month broker-sold CD for example was yielding an average 8.09 % in the latest week a fifth of a percentage point lower than the week before
In late April when interest rates were at their recent highs short-term CDs sold by brokers were offering yields half a percentage point or more higher than banks
CD yields are generally expected to fall further in coming weeks
What happened in the stock market and the bigger trade deficit reported yesterday make it unlikely that short-term interest rates will rise any time soon said Mr. Mehl of Banxquote
Even before the market drop rates were down about half a percentage point said Robert J. Hutchinson senior vice president for retail marketing at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York
That puts pressure on CD rates
Conservatives have an important decision to make this fall
At the recent meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund the Bush administration announced its intention to decide by yearend the size of the next increase in the IMF 's capital base
While the U.S. share of the increase probably will not reach the 12 billion or more implicit in the IMF 's request for a doubling of its 90 billion capital the administration probably will agree to a multibillion-dollar increase
This would be consistent with its unwavering support for the Brady Plan and G-7 exchange-rate intervention and with its financial commitment to Mexico Poland and others
The IMF has several reasons for requesting the increase
Its role in the economies of developing countries has grown steadily since the 1970s
The size and pace of disbursements will accelerate further under the Brady Plan which promises larger and earlier disbursements to approved countries
At least three other factors have encouraged the IMF to insist on increased capital
First it argues that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets for which it feels some responsibility
Second the World Bank 's recent 75 billion capital increase 14 billion from the U.S. has left the IMF feeling less than first fiddle among international financial institutions
Third the IMF would like to meet Japan 's request for increased ownership currently 4.5 %
Japan has supported a larger role for the IMF in developing-country debt issues and is an important financial resource for IMF-guided programs in developing countries
While international politics may argue for the capital increase there is a clear economic case against it
Opponents of the increase argue that the IMF practices central planning while supporting ineffective governments
They question whether the IMF has any role in developing countries given its original mandate to assist industrial countries in balance-of-payments emergencies
Opponents show that there are already more funds available than commendable reform efforts
They worry that new IMF funding of developing countries will simply end up substituting IMF debt for reschedulable commercial bank debt a bad trade all around
They believe microeconomics which addresses the problems of markets investment climate and management practices is the key to developing-country growth not the IMF 's Keynesian focus on trade deficits quarterly targets and government debt
They point at the numerous developing-country governments that have inflated taxed and regulated themselves into despair under successive IMF programs
Decisions on increases in the IMF 's capital base traditionally are made by the administration with subsequent authorization by Congress
The last U.S. congressional authorization in 1983 was a political donnybrook and carried a 6 billion housing program along with it to secure adequate votes
The politics of the 1990 congressional authorization are likely to be similar to those of previous authorizations
Liberals may support the stabilizing quasi-governmental role of the IMF on two conditions that the administration give assurances that liberal Democrats ' support will not be used against them in congressional re-election campaigns and that the legislation address with dollars social and environmental concerns
Conservative Republicans will be given the choice of supporting or fighting their party 's popular president in an election year
A U.S. decision to refuse the IMF its capital increase or limit it to 25 % would bring a major change in international economic policy and could not be taken lightly
Commentators would fret over the implications for the G-7 coordination process and the stability of world financial markets
Because commercial banks and the developing-country governments believe they will get a piece of any capital increase a scaled-down IMF mission would leave both feeling shortchanged
Furthermore a U.S. rejection of the capital increase and transfer of shares to Japan would give Japan an argument against future calls for economic burden-sharing
On the other hand a decision to increase the IMF 's capital would reinforce the central economic role of multilateral institutions in developing countries
With the increase even more developing-country energy and talent would be diverted from creating profitable economic systems to setting up economic planning ministries that generate IMF-approved economic plans
Upping the ante could slow economic development even further as countries delay market-opening steps in anticipation of richer multilateral support
Conservatives should take a position prior to the administration 's year-end deadline
The issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase rather than its purpose
If conservatives do n't support an increase in the IMF 's capital then it is incumbent on them to speak up now and explain the alternative

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange fined and suspended two commodities traders accused of making prearranged trades with each other that allegedly cheated a customer
Merc officials said Gary N. Roberts was disciplined following the exchange 's investigation of his trading in several commodities pits from July to November 1988
The Merc said Mr. Roberts withheld from the market certain orders in cooperation with another trader David Stein
The Merc fined Mr. Roberts 15,000 and suspended his trading membership for three years
Also he and Mr. Stein were ordered to make restitution of 35,000 to a customer
Mr. Stein was fined 25,000 and suspended for three years
Messrs. Roberts and Stein could n't be reached for comment
The Merc said that as part of the disciplinary settlement neither man admitted nor denied the alleged violations
Neither was among the 46 traders indicted last August in a federal investigation of traders at both the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade
In a move that could pose a new competitive challenge to Time Warner Inc. 's powerful Home Box Office cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. agreed to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc. from Viacom Inc. for 225 million
The purchase comes after nearly three years of on-again off-again talks between TCI and Viacom which has also discussed the sale of an interest in Showtime with other cable operators
Showtime is a distant No. 2 to Home Box Office and in May filed a 2.5 billion antitrust suit against Time Warner charging the company and its HBO and American Television cable units with conspiring to monopolize the pay TV business
HBO has close to 24 million subscribers to its HBO and Cinemax networks while Showtime and its sister service The Movie Channel have only about 10 million according to Paul Kagan Associates a Carmel Calif. research firm
For TCI the investment in Showtime puts it in an unusual position as the largest cable operator with control of close to 12 million of the nation 's 52 million cable subscribers TCI is HBO 's largest customer
But TCI President John Malone has long been concerned about HBO 's dominance of the pay TV business and has been eager to keep Showtime as a healthy competitor
It is important to the cable industry that we have a vibrant and competitive pay-television marketplace Mr. Malone said in a statement
In a telephone interview Robert Thomson TCI senior vice president said Showtime 's suit against HBO does n't involve us and nothing we 're doing here bears any relationship to that
He added We do n't intend to be drawn into it noting that TCI wo n't play any active role in the management of Showtime
Linking up Showtime with the largest cable operator in the U.S. could sharply boost its subscribers
TCI said it may bring in other cable operators as investors a practice it has employed in the past with investments in other cable networks such as The Discovery Channel
Additional cable partners could boost subscribers even further
Time Warner declined comment
In addition to owning HBO Time Warner owns American Television & Communications Inc. the nation 's second largest cable operator after TCI
Viacom also owns cable systems but it is the 14th largest operator of such systems with less than one million subscribers
The TCI investment is a big victory for Viacom 's chief executive officer Frank Biondi and Winston H. Cox president of the Showtime unit
This takes any question of Showtime 's viability and puts it away once and for all Mr. Biondi said in a telephone interview
The fight between HBO and Showtime is particularly acrimonious because Mr. Biondi is the former chief executive of HBO and Mr. Cox served as chief of marketing for the service
They were both hired by Sumner Redstone the Boston billionaire who took control of Viacom three years ago in a leveraged buy-out
Time Warner has vigorously denied all of Viacom 's allegations
Boeing Co. already struck by its Machinists union briefly called off contract talks with its engineers and labeled their demands grossly excessive
Later however the company agreed to meet on Monday with the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association after a federal mediator intervened according to the union
A spokesman for the engineers said the company asked the union to reduce its demands which included a 19 % pay hike in the first year and 8 % in the second and third years
The union represents about 28,000 engineers and technical workers
Its contract expires Dec. 1
Meanwhile a federal mediator is scheduled to meet today with Boeing officials and representatives of 55,000 striking Machinists
It will take several meetings to resolve this said a spokesman for the Machinists union
We do n't want to bring back something the members will reject
Machinists already have rejected a package that would have provided a 10 % pay raise plus bonuses over the three-year life of the contract
It also would have reduced mandatory overtime
Investor Asher Edelman increased his stake in Intelogic Trace Inc. and cleared the way for additional purchases
It was n't clear however whether the actions were related to a battle between the corporate raider and New York attorney Martin Ackerman for control of Datapoint Corp. a San Antonio Texas-based data-processing systems maker
Intelogic Trace a computer services company was spun off to Datapoint holders in 1985 after Mr. Edelman gained control
After Mr. Ackerman announced he was soliciting consents from shareholders in order to wrest control of Datapoint from Mr. Edelman the corporate raider purchased 30 % of Datapoint 's shares
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Mr. Edelman said from Sept. 29 to Oct. 13 he acquired 309,500 shares of Intelogic common shares for 2.25 to 2.375 each
The purchases increased his stake to 16.2 % of the shares outstanding
The filing also said certain provisions which apply to persons acquiring 20 % or more of Intelogic common stock were waived by Intelogic for Mr. Edelman who is chairman of the company
Mr. Edelman could n't be reached for comment
The federal government should make free voluntary testing for the AIDS virus the cornerstone of an expanded campaign to stop the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome the Hudson Institute recommended
By encouraging massive routine voluntary testing we can enable society to voluntarily segregate itself sexually into two groups those who carry the virus and those who do not the Indianapolis research organization said in a new report
The report takes a more alarmed view of AIDS and recommends a more sweeping response than many other analyses
It warns that the AIDS epidemic may reduce the rate of growth of the work force curb productivity gains and slow economic growth
It contends that current government policy is failing to stem the AIDS epidemic because it suggests the use of condoms can make sex safe
But the report says The only safe sex is sex between uninfected partners and testing is the only way to learn of infection
Hudson 's researchers estimated that it would cost less than 650 million a year to test the entire population between the ages of 12 and 65 years old
In addition the report recommends that federal and state governments provide free treatment to all who test positive
An unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap for August dragged the dollar lower Tuesday but profit-taking on short positions helped the currency rebound to close mixed against major counterparts
While the market kept careful tabs on Wall Street 's gyrations it shrugged off a modest downturn in equities to bid the dollar well above the day 's lows
Soon after the release of the U.S. trade figures the dollar plunged to an intraday low of 140.95 yen
It also declined against the mark but did n't reach its intraday low of 1.8435 marks until two hours later
The unit stabilized about midday New York time at around 1.85 marks and 141 yen prompting unconfirmed rumors that the U.S. Federal Reserve had intervened to blunt the unit 's tumble
The dollar finished at its intraday highs
Dealers noted that the foreign exchange market 's initial bearish reaction to the U.S. trade figures was tempered later by a calmer reassessment of the data
The U.S. Commerce Department reported a 10.77 billion deficit in August compared with a revised July deficit of 8.24 billion
Economists had expected a 9.1 billion gap
The August figure reflected a 6.4 % rise in imports and a 0.2 % drop in exports
Marc M. Goloven an economist with Manufacturers Hanover Trust in New York said that while the figures appear to indicate a sadly deteriorating U.S. trade performance there 's still enough positive news in the data to justify buying dollars
He said that while the U.S. trade gap with Canada has widened significantly the trade deficit with Western Europe and Japan continues to narrow
And he added that manufactured goods exports are still rising
The dollar 's near-term path remains foggy according to currencny analysts who characterize the market as bewildering
In late New York trading yesterday the dollar was quoted at 1.8667 marks down from 1.8685 marks late Monday and at 142.75 yen up from 141.85 yen late Monday
Sterling was unchanged at 1.5753
In Tokyo Wednesday the U.S. currency opened for trading at 142.55 yen unchanged from Tuesday 's Tokyo close
Later the U.S. currency fell to about 142.25 yen on news reports of the San Francisco earthquake
Some analysts remain bullish and point out that the dollar continues to be well bid despite key rate increases in Europe and Japan several weeks of aggressive dollar sales by the world central banks some traders estimate that the barrage of sales topped 12 billion and a 190-point plunge on the New York Stock Exchange
They note that the U.S. unit is trading at the upper end of the presumed target zones established by the Group of Seven trading partners
The G-7 comprises West Germany the U.S. France the U.K. Italy Canada and Japan
The so-called Louvre accord was seen to have set ranges of 1.70 marks to 1.90 marks and 120 yen to 140 yen
They say that the recent injection of liquidity into the U.S. banking system has been modest and they do n't anticipate significant easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve
The Fed arranged 1.5 billion of customer repurchase agreements Tuesday the second repurchase agreement in two days
The move which injects capital into the system is seen as an effort to reassure the finanicial markets that the U.S. central bank is ready to provide the ample liquidity
But other analysts contend that while the Fed 's move to loosen credit has n't been aggressive it nevertheless sends a clear signal that at least for now the Fed has relaxed its grip on credit
They add that the Fed has allowed the key federal funds interest rate to dip to about 8 5\/8 % from its levels of just below 9 % last week
The federal funds rate is the overnight lending rate that banks charge each other
Market participants said that the mark continues to post the most significant gains against the dollar

National Semiconductor Corp. said it settled a four-year-old patent infringement case against Linear Technology Corp. by accepting a 3 million payment from Linear in exchange for granting Linear irrevocable licenses for all products involved
The two companies also agreed to settle any future property rights issues over the next 10 years through binding arbitration both companies said
The products are so-called analog integrated circuits that have applications in the consumer electronics automobile and electronic instrumentation markets

The electronics concern said it already has paid 2 million of the settlement to National Semiconductor Santa Clara Calif. and will pay the remaining 1 million in equal installments over the next eight quarters
The payments are n't expected to have an impact on coming operating results Linear added

Procter & Gamble Co. Cincinnati expanding its presence in the food service market said it acquired Maryland Club Foods a coffee supplier from an investor group led by F. Philip Handy of Winter Park Fla
Terms were n't disclosed
Houston-based Maryland Club Foods which had sales of about 200 million last year sells coffee under the Maryland Club and Butter-Nut brands to restaurants hotels offices and airlines
The acquisition gives us additional production capacity for the food service coffee business and a stronger distribution network a P&G spokesman said
P&G already sells its Folgers ground roast coffee to food service concerns but not to as many markets as Maryland Club
For example P&G up until now has n't sold coffee to airlines and does only limited business with hotels and large restaurant chains
Maryland Club also distributes tea which fits well with P&G 's Tender Leaf brand and hot cocoa products
The company said the acquisition has been completed and reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission
The purchase includes a coffee-roasting plant in Omaha Neb. and a leased facility in Houston

President Bush will veto a bill funding the Departments of Labor Education and Health and Human Services because it would allow federal funding of abortions for victims of rape and incest the White House said
Mr. Bush had threatened a veto previously
But he put off a firm decision while his aides and legislators searched for a compromise that would tighten requirements for such abortions in a way acceptable to the president
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said negotiations between Bush aides and lawmakers ended Monday without success
Most lawmakers think it will be extremely difficult for Mr. Bush 's opponents on the abortion issue to round up the votes needed to override the veto
But there still may be prolonged debate and political maneuvering that holds up the 156.7 billion funding bill for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1
Mr. Bush has said he personally approves of abortions in the cases of rape incest and danger to the life of the mother
But he has opposed Medicaid funding of abortions for poor women who say they are victims of rape and incest arguing that those exceptions are enforced so loosely that they open the way for abortions for other women

J.P. Morgan & Co. New York will help the statutory managers of DFC New Zealand Ltd. to evaluate the failed investment bank 's condition
Earlier this month the Reserve Bank of New Zealand the country 's central bank appointed the managers to run the investment bank and pay creditors
DFC asked the central bank to appoint managers after it revised loan-loss provisions to around the same level of shareholders ' funds of 180 million New Zealand dollars 105.4 million
DFC is held 80 % by National Provident Fund New Zealand 's largest pension fund and 20 % by Salomon Brothers Inc. the investment-bank and securities-firm subsidiary of Salomon Inc. in New York
A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan parent of the bank Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. confirmed its appointment to assist the managers but declined to elaborate
The managers said in a brief statement yesterday that Morgan will help evaluate DFC 's position and help determine alternatives
The managers do n't expect to complete the evaluation until Nov. 30
An experimental vaccine can alter the immune response of people infected with the AIDS virus a prominent U.S. scientist said
However that does n't mean they can benefit from the vaccine
Its effectiveness ca n't be determined until a large clinical trial is undertaken by the Army in January according to Robert Redfield chief of acquired immune deficiency syndrome research at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research
Dr. Redfield 's report on early experiments using an AIDS vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of West Haven Conn. came at a meeting of AIDS vaccine researchers in Florida late Monday
The vaccine VaxSyn HIV-1 has been safely given to 14 people some of whom are experiencing substantial increases in certain antibodies
The conventional wisdom used to be that you could n't modify the immune response of an infected individual by innoculating them with synthetic viral proteins Dr. Redfield said
We 've demonstrated that you can
He said certain volunteers developed kinds of antibodies associated with early AIDS
Other antibodies sparked by the preparation are of a sort rarely present in large quantities in infected or ill individuals he added

Matra S.A. reported its 1989 first-half profit soared 88 % and indicated that its previous estimate of a 50 % rise in earnings for all of 1989 will be exceeded by a wide margin
The French electronics and defense group said attributable consolidated net profit for the first six months of 1989 totaled 244 million francs 38.4 million compared with 130 million francs 20.5 million in the corresponding period of Operating profit climbed 51 % to 572 million francs from 378 million in the first half of 1988
Matra said the sharp improvement in net profit partly reflected a decline of 59 million francs in the group 's net loss from nonrecurring items in the first half of this year to 104 million francs from 163 million a year earlier
There was also a decline in the group 's net financial costs to 25 million francs from 50 million a year before
These movements were offset however by a steep rise in corporate income tax payments to 199 million francs from 35 million in the first six months of 1988
Matra said the sharp rise in its first-half earnings was based on a 15 % gain in consolidated revenue to 10.16 billion francs from 8.85 billion a year earlier
Rep. Lee Hamilton D. Ind
said he and Rep. Byron Dorgan D. N.D
are backing away from their proposal to make the Treasury Secretary a voting member of the Federal Reserve panel that sets monetary policy
Rep. Hamilton said the bill will be modified substantially to call for two meetings each year between the Fed 's open market committee and the Treasury Secretary the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and the director of the Office of Management and Budget
The original bill was strongly opposed by the Fed and publicly criticized by friends of the Fed as an attempt to undermine the central bank 's independence
Fed critics however hailed it as a long overdue attempt to bring a measure of openness and democracy to the setting of monetary policy
Rep. Hamilton said the purpose of the meetings would be to improve communications and perhaps coordination between the executive branch and the Fed
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan meets regularly for lunch with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and talks frequently with Budget Director Richard Darman and Michael Boskin chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers
The administration officials do n't ordinarily meet with the entire membership of the open market committee

Fiat S.p
A. Italy 's leading industrial group is conducting concrete talks with West Germany 's Daimler-Benz AG on a series of projects in the aerospace sector Fiat officials said
However the officials said it was too early to disclose the nature of the proposed projects or indicate when the talks might be concluded
Daimler-Benz Chairman Edzard Reuter told Milan 's financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore that talks are taking place between both companies ' aerospace units
While Mr. Reuter 's comments please us very much there currently are no talks in progress regarding the automotive industry a Fiat spokeswoman said
In the interview Mr. Reuter said he is thinking foremost of cooperation in the truck sector but in the long run I do n't want to rule out that we can also come a bit closer in personal cars
Roberto Morelli Italy analyst for County Natwest Securities in London said that right now the market is n't being influenced by that kind of news referring to the conditional nature of the talks mentioned by Mr. Reuter and by the uncertainty surrounding world stock exchanges this week

Spooked investors despite their stampede to dump takeover stocks should hold on tight to their Jaguar shares
That 's the view of some analysts here who argue that Britain 's leading maker of luxury cars still may have two U.S. auto giants battling for it
Yesterday Ford Motor disclosed that it has raised its holding in Jaguar to 10.4 % from 5 %
Both Ford and its rival General Motors recently set their sights on grabbing significant minority stakes in the British company
Ford 's latest move increases the pressure on GM to complete its current talks with Jaguar quickly
GM is likely to reach the cooperative operating pact it has been seeking in about two weeks knowledgeable individuals say
At that point investors may face a long bumpy ride
A victor in the fight for Jaguar may not emerge until after the expiration late next year of British government takeover restrictions
The curbs prevent a buyer from purchasing more than 15 % of Jaguar shares without permission
This is an exceptionally odd takeover battle says London analyst Christopher Will of Shearson Lehman Hutton
Jaguar 's American depositary receipts were up 3\/8 yesterday in a down market closing at 10 3\/8
Jaguar 's ADRs make the company one of the most widely held United Kingdom stocks in the U.S. with more than one-fourth of its shares owned there
Jaguar topped the most-active list for the U.S. over-the-counter market Monday
And on London 's Stock Exchange Monday 18.5 million shares were traded far above the usual volume
Ford 's share purchases undoubtedly accounted for much of Monday 's heavy trading
Last week many Jaguar shareholders took their money and ran
Fears that Ford 's ardor might be cooling put Jaguar shares into reverse after GM confirmed its friendly negotiations with Jaguar
But yesterday 's announcement indicates that Ford has n't lost interest
Both Shearson 's Mr
Will and Stephen Reitman European auto analyst at the London brokerage firm UBS-Phillips & Drew recently switched their Jaguar recommendations to hold from buy
Sit tight through the coming volatility Mr. Reitman suggests though he concedes that many small investors will find Jaguar 's zigzags too hard to swallow
But a crucial point is how Ford reacts when GM the world 's largest auto maker firms up its proposed deal with Jaguar
At the moment Ford executives will say little beyond reiterating their desire to raise Ford 's Jaguar stake to about 15 %
GM is expected to inject roughly 200 million 316 million by acquiring some Jaguar shares and then win Jaguar management 's promise of an eventual 30 % stake
Analysts believe the car makers also will create joint ventures to develop new executive models doubling Jaguar 's yearly output of 50,000 cars
Jaguar shareholders would have to bless such a far-reaching accord
Ford might challenge the proposal by offering a full bid if holders and the U.K. government agreed to drop the anti-takeover barrier early
I think Ford is going to come out with full guns blazing Mr. Reitman says
Ford wants Jaguar very much
U.S. takeover-stock speculators who may own between 20 % and 30 % of Jaguar could give Ford enough votes to block the GM deal
GM might counterbid
Then Mr
Will says you get a bidding war between two very rich very determined international companies
He believes Jaguar 's share price could zoom to between 8 and 10 12.60 to 15.80
There 's quite a bit of value left in the Jaguar shares here even though they have run up lately says Doug Johnson a fund manager for Seattle-based Safeco Asset Management
At the moment he intends to keep the firm 's 180,000 Jaguar shares
The risk is that Jaguar 's share price could slump if GM 's agreement with Jaguar effectively locks out its U.S. rival
Ford 's appetite to attack Jaguar could gradually wane over time particularly if Saab is a reasonably attractive proposition says John Lawson an auto analyst at London 's Nomura Research Institute
He thinks Saab-Scania AB on Friday will announce the sale of 50 % of its car division to Ford the companies have been discussing closer cooperation for months
Clifford Stahl president and chief investment officer of C-S Capital Advisors Inc. two weeks ago sold his Cincinnati firm 's 107,100 Jaguar ADRs at about 10 each making a tidy profit on a holding purchased at 4 7\/8 in early May
I thought the probabilities of a bidding war happening were less he says
Of course that was before Ford 's latest move

Newport Electronics Inc. of Santa Ana Calif. said Milton B. Hollander who holds a 49.4 % stake requested a special shareholders ' meeting next Wednesday to remove four current directors and elect an alternative slate
Mr. Hollander 's High Technology Holding Co. of Stamford Conn. acquired most of its stake last August in an 11-a-share tender offer for Newport a maker of electronic-measuring devices
Newport said Mr. Hollander is asking shareholders to retain only one director James R. Lees a Newport vice president
The board is n't proposing a slate of its own and the other four current directors do n't want to serve beyond the special meeting date Newport said
Mr. Hollander is the new owner and wants to exercise control said Barret B. Weekes Newport 's chairman
Sandoz AG a major Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group said that its group sales rose 25 % to 9.482 billion francs 5.80 billion in the first nine months of this year with strong gains in all divisions
A year earlier sales totaled 7.567 billion francs
Positive currency rates and strong sales growth led to a substantial rise in consolidated profit in the period although the company did n't provide figures as is customary with Swiss companies
Sandoz said it expects a substantial increase in consolidated profit for the full year barring major currency rate changes
Amstrad PLC a British maker of computer hardware and communications equipment posted a 52 % plunge in pretax profit for the latest year
The 76.6 million 120.6 million in pretax profit for the 12 months to June 30 was down from 160 million 252 million a year earlier and below market expectations of 80 million and 90 million
The slump in profit which came despite steady sales was attributed to increased costs for parts and problems with model introductions
Amstrad 's profit after taxes fell a similarly steep 51 % to 51.1 million from 105 million a year earlier
Sales edged up fractionally to 626.3 million from 625.4 million a year earlier
Microsoft Corp. 's earnings growth continued to outstrip that of most of its competitors and customers in the personal-computer industry as it reported a 36 % jump in fiscal first-quarter earnings on a 33 % revenue gain
The Redmond Wash. company a bellwether provider of operating systems and software for personal-computer makers and users reported net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 of 49.6 million or 87 cents a share up from 36.6 million or 65 cents a share in the year-ago period
Revenue rose to 235.2 million from 176.4 million
Microsoft previously indicated it would have a strong quarter by forecasting its revenue gain on Oct. 4 causing a 6.50 a share jump in its stock
But its stock jumped again yesterday as it disclosed surprisingly strong margins on those sales
Microsoft 's stock rose 2.875 a share in national over-the-counter trading to 78.625
The stock had hit a high of 81 a share early last week but collapsed to 73.50 in the Friday stock plunge
The company had been experiencing softening margins because of increased sales of software applications which have lower margins than do operating systems
But the company said that trend was offset in the first quarter by better economies of scale and efficiencies in manufacturing
As a result Microsoft 's cost of goods as a percentage of sales fell 17 % from the year-ago quarter and 13 % from the previous period
The trend drove up the aftertax margin net income as a percentage of revenues to 21.1 % in the quarter compared with 20.7 % a year earlier
Microsoft officials said the strong results also reflected continuing high demand for its software applications and operating systems
While it has predicted that overall growth in unit sales of personal computers is slowing to about a 10 % yearly rate its own products are selling at a much faster rate because many are geared to the high-performance end of the market
That segment continues to post strong quarter-to-quarter gains while the low-end or commodity segment of the industry is experiencing sluggish growth or even sales declines
Compared with its previous quarter the final period of its 1989 fiscal year net rose 9 % and sales rose 7 %

BroadBeach Associates Inc. the Los Angeles investment partnership whose 62-a-share bid for McGill Manufacturing Co. was topped recently by a competing offer from a Swedish concern disclosed that it sold its entire 7 % McGill stake
McGill a Valparaiso Ind. ball-bearing manufacturer had rebuffed BroadBeach 's proposal

The Paris-based group said its earlier projection that group profit for all of 1989 would be close to the 322.7 million francs posted for 1988 remains valid
Taking into account nonrecurring gains and losses Hachette 's group net income for the first six months of this year totaled 246.6 million francs practically double the year-earlier figure of 124.5 million francs
Analysts said Hachette 's earnings in the second half might be boosted by a capital gain from the sale of the Paris headquarters of a newspaper-delivery company that is 49 % owned by Hachette
Oncor Inc. Gaithersburg Md. said it received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market a genetic test that will assist in diagnosis and treatment of leukemia and lymph cancer
The B\/T gene rearrangement test is more accurate than existing tests for diagnosing the type of cancer whether it has spread or whether there is a recurrence following treatment said Oncor President Stephen Turner
Mr. Turner said the test initially will be used in conjunction with biopsies and other tests but eventually might become the benchmark for tumor analysis
Mr. Turner said the test will be shipped in 45 days to hospitals and clinical laboratories
Dr. Wyndham Wilson a cancer treatment specialist at the National Cancer Institute said the test is widely used in research centers but is n't having a major impact because it is only occasionally useful in choosing the most effective treatment
But the test may prove to be more sensitive in determining whether a tumor has spread or returned following treatment Dr. Wilson said
We do n't know yet how useful it 's going to be he said
Oncor a six-year-old developer of genetic medical tests projects that the cancer test will help it to post its first-ever profit during the first quarter of 1990 Mr. Turner said
The company will charge 35 for a test and projects about 2 million in revenue from the test during the first 12 months of marketing he said
